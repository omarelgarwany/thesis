\section{Phenotype quality control}
With every inpatient visit, patients receive a primary and secondary diagnosis. These diagnoses are recorded using a hierarchical clinical diagnosis framework known as The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) \cite{Hirsch2016-mw}. ICD is a hierarchical framework whereby each medical diagnosis is given an alphanumeric code, and all sub-classifications of any given diagnosis are nested within it. For example, K50 codes for Crohn's disease, while K50.1 codes for Crohn's disease in the large intestine. In this chapter, I will refer to the main ICD codes as "level 1 codes" and their sub-classifications "level 2 codes". The level 1 code for perianal involvement is K60 (K60: Fissure and fistula of the anal and rectal regions)

To understand the genetic architecture of perianal involvement in the general population, I performed a GWAS analysis between all-cause peri-anal disease (pAD) and healthy individuals in the UKBB. 

\subsection{Control exclusion criteria}
To avoid contamination of controls with lower digestive tract disorders that may be true pAD cases that were incorrectly diagnosed, I applied a set of control exclusion criteria. Specifically, I excluded from the control set any individuals who had an ICD-10 hospital diagnosis of K55-K64 and their corresponding ICD-9 codes as demonstrated in Table \ref{table:ukbb_ctrl_excl_criteria}; collectively grouped as "Other diseases of intestines"). These ICD codes indicate symptoms that may resemble pAD symptoms upon presentation, and include ano-rectal bleeding (K55 vascular disorders of the intestine, K57 diverticular disease of intestine and K64 Haemorrhoids and perianal venous thrombosis), or a change in bowel habits (K56 Paralytic ileus and K58 Irritable bowel syndrome), perianal fistula or abscess (K60 fissure and fistula of the anal  and K61), any ano-rectal abnormalities (K62), or proximal fistulas or abscesses (K63). In total, I excluded 133,398 from 481,756 pAD controls (27.7\%).

\subsection{Case inclusion criteria}
To define the case cohort, I identified all individuals with ICD-10 and ICD-9 codes K60
and 565 as case. In total, 5,257 UKBB participants had at least a single visit where they received either a primary or secondary pAD diagnosis or its corresponding ICD-9 code ("anal fissure and fistula"; 565). There are six level 2 codes within K60, representing two broad categories of pAD: fissures and fistulas. Three codes are used for acute and chronic fissures and three codes for acute and chronic fistulas. 92\% of patients (4,858) presented with either K60.1, K60.2 or K60.3 ("chronic anal fissure", "anal fissure, unspecified" and "anal fistula", respectively; Table \ref{table:ukbb_level2_nums}).

  \subsection{pAD case enrichment}
  The availability of a large number of clinical diagnoses and phenotypes for UKB participants enables a thorough characterisation of the GWAS case cohort. I aimed to understand the cohort composition and identify which ICD-10 codes are enriched in cases versus controls. For each ICD-10 code, I compared the prevalence in pAD cases versus controls, and I formally tested the enrichment of 1,693 codes using Fisher's exact test. \\

  199 codes were significantly enriched (Fisherâ€™s exact  P-value < $3\times10^{-5}$; Table ). Overall, the enrichment odds ratio was higher than expected (median odds ratio=1.36), likely as a consequence of sampling a disease cohort within a healthy population cohort. Haemorrhoids (I84) was the most significantly enriched diagnosis (P-value $6\times10^{-98}$; 38\% in pAD cases versus 6\% in controls; Fisher's odds ratio=9.7). This is likely due to the higher likelihood of diagnosing Haemorrhoids in patients with more serious ano-rectal disorders such as pAD, compared to the general population where haemorrhoids patients with no other ano-rectal manifestations are less likely to seek medical advice, and may therefore remain undiagnosed. 



  \section{UKBB GWAS}
  Using the pAD case control cohort, I performed a GWAS within UKBB using REGENIE v3.2.5 [ref]. After excluding individuals with missing genotypes or with discordant reported and inferred sex, I conducted the GWAS between 4,606 pAD cases and 332,234 pAD controls (see Methods for genotype data quality control and imputation). After filtering out variants with low imputation quality (INFO < 0.4) and minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01, a total of 9,705,089 variants were tested. The GWAs summary statistics did not exhibit genomic inflation (median $\chi^{2}=0.48$; $\lambda_{GC}=1.06$). Three loci achieved genome-wide significant association (P-value < $5\times10^{-8}$). All index variants were well-imputed (INFO > 0.9). Additionally, their MAF matched population MAFs from both 1000 Genomes Project and gnomAD (see Methods for how MAF deviation from the general population was assessed).
