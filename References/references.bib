               introduce stratified genomic structural equation modeling, which
               we use to identify gene sets that disproportionately contribute
               to genetic risk sharing. This includes protein-truncating
               variant-intolerant genes expressed in excitatory and GABAergic
               brain cells that are enriched for genetic overlap across
               disorders with psychotic features. Multivariate association
               analyses detect 152 (20 new) independent loci that act on the

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that perianal fistulas are
               associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of
               life, their prevalence in Europe is unknown. The aim of this
               study was to estimate the prevalence of perianal fistulas in
               Europe, overall and according to etiology. METHODS: Two
               independent literature reviews were performed using different
               search strategies to maximize the identification of potentially
               relevant studies. Data from relevant articles were used to
               estimate the prevalence of perianal fistulas in Europe. The
               robustness of the estimate was evaluated using data from a large
               population-based database from the UK. RESULTS: A total of 26
               studies provided epidemiological data on perianal fistulas, of
               which 16 provided suitable data to estimate the prevalence.
               Estimations using these data yielded a total prevalence of 1.69
               per 10,000 population. Cryptoglandular infection and Crohn's
               disease (CD) were the predominant etiologies, with prevalence
               rates at 0.86 and 0.76 per 10,000 population, respectively.
               Comparison of prevalence data from the UK population-based
               database with the European population resulted in a standardized
               prevalence estimate of all perianal fistulas of 1.83 per 10,000
               population, confirming the robustness of the literature-based
               estimate. CONCLUSION: Although in terms of incidence
               cryptoglandular fistulas were clearly predominant, the
               prevalence of fistulas in CD and cryptoglandular infection
               appeared more balanced. This is due to the longer duration and
               higher frequency of relapses of fistulas in CD. The estimated
               prevalence implies that perianal fistulas meet the criteria to
               be considered as a rare condition in Europe (prevalence less
               than 5 per 10,000 population). FUNDING: This study was funded by

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Anal fistula is a pathological connection between
               the anal canal and perianal skin, which most commonly develops
               from an infected anal crypt. While the majority of anal fistulas
               are idiopathic, they are also associated with Crohn's disease
               (CD) and other inflammatory conditions. The prevalence of anal
               fistula is estimated to be 1-2 per 10000 patients, but
               population-based studies on anal fistula epidemiology are
               limited and outdated. AIM: To assess the prevalence of anal
               fistula and relevant comorbidities, with and without CD in the
               United Kingdom and Europe. METHODS: A retrospective
               population-representative observational cohort study was
               performed in The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a United
               Kingdom primary care database. Mid-year point prevalence of anal
               fistula was calculated on the first of July for each year
               between 2014 and 2017. Estimates were calculated for anal
               fistula overall and by CD status and standardized to the United
               Kingdom and European population. Prevalence of relevant
               comorbidities including lymphogranuloma venereum, hidradenitis
               suppurativa, anal presentation of sexually transmitted diseases,
               diabetes mellitus, and radiation in the pelvic area was
               reported. RESULTS: The United Kingdom-standardized overall point
               prevalence of anal fistula was 1.80 (95\%CI: 1.65-1.94) per
               10000 patients in 2017, while the Europe standardized estimate
               was 1.83 (95\%CI: 1.68-1.98) per 10000 patients. Both these
               standardized point prevalence estimates ranged from 1.89 to 2.36
               between 2014-2016. The United Kingdom-standardized point
               prevalence of anal fistula without CD was 1.35 (95\%CI:
               1.23-1.48) per 10000 patients, while the Europe-standardized
               estimate was 1.39 (95\%CI: 1.26-1.52) per 10000 patients. In
               contrast, the standardized point prevalence estimate of anal
               fistula with CD was lower for both United Kingdom and Europe
               (0.44; 95\%CI United Kingdom: 0.37-0.52, 95\%CI Europe:
               0.37-0.51) per 10000 patients in 2017. In 2017, 19\% of anal
               fistula patients without CD and 13\% of anal fistula patients
               with CD had at least one relevant comorbidity. These results
               show that anal fistulas are infrequent in the general
               population. 24.5\% of prevalent anal fistulas are associated
               with CD, but other potentially etiological comorbidities are
               rare. CONCLUSION: This real-world evidence study estimated the
               United Kingdom-standardized prevalence of anal fistula was 1.80
               per 10000 patients in 2017. Approximately 25\% of cases may be
               associated with CD, while other comorbidities are rare.",

               regulator of colonic macrophage-mediated immune responses
               against the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. In the
               immune response phase, RBP-J promoted pathogen clearance by
               enhancing intestinal macrophage-elicited Th17 cell immune
               responses, which was achieved by maintenance of
               C/EBP$\beta$-dependent IL-6 production by overcoming

  author    = "Ostareck, Dirk H and Ostareck-Lederer, Antje",
  abstract  = "Innate immune response is triggered by pathogen components, like
               lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria. LPS
               initiates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, which involves
               mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor
               kappa B (NF$\kappa$B) in different pathway branches and
               ultimately induces inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
               expression, macrophage migration and phagocytosis. Timely gene
               transcription and post-transcriptional control of gene
               expression confer the adequate synthesis of signaling molecules.
               As trans-acting factors RNA binding proteins (RBPs) contribute
               significantly to the surveillance of gene expression. RBPs are
               involved in the regulation of mRNA processing, localization,
               stability and translation. Thereby they enable rapid cellular
               responses to inflammatory mediators and facilitate a coordinated
               systemic immune response. Specific RBP binding to conserved

               that cell type-specific binding of transcription factors (TF) is
               critical to gene regulation. However, assessing the contribution
               of genetic variation in TF-binding sites to disease heritability
               is challenging, as binding is often cell type-specific and
               annotations from directly measured TF binding are not currently
               available for most cell type-TF pairs. We investigate approaches
               to annotate TF binding, including directly measured chromatin
               data and sequence-based predictions. We find that TF-binding
               annotations constructed by intersecting sequence-based
               TF-binding predictions with cell type-specific chromatin data
               explain a large fraction of heritability across a broad set of
               diseases and corresponding cell types; this strategy of
               constructing annotations addresses both the limitation that
               identical sequences may be bound or unbound depending on
               surrounding chromatin context and the limitation that
               sequence-based predictions are generally not cell type-specific.
               We partitioned the heritability of 49 diseases and complex
               traits using stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score
               regression with the baseline-LD model (which is not cell
               type-specific) plus the new annotations. We determined that 100
               bp windows around MotifMap sequenced-based TF-binding
               predictions intersected with a union of six cell type-specific
               chromatin marks (imputed using ChromImpute) performed best, with
               an 58\% increase in heritability enrichment compared to the
               chromatin marks alone (11.6$\times$ vs. 7.3$\times$, P = 9
               $\times$ 10-14 for difference) and a 20\% increase in cell
               type-specific signal conditional on annotations from the
               baseline-LD model (P = 8 $\times$ 10-11 for difference). Our
               results show that TF-binding annotations explain substantial
               disease heritability and can help refine genome-wide association
               signals.",

               pre-illness diet in patients with recent IBD in comparison with
               matched population and clinic controls. METHODS: Quantified
               dietary histories were obtained from 87 patients with recent IBD
               (54 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 33 Crohn's disease (CD)) and 144
               controls. Odds ratios (OR) for IBD were derived for intake
               levels of various foods. RESULTS: A high sucrose consumption was
               associated with an increased risk for IBD (OR 2.85 (p = 0.03)
               against population controls and 5.3 (p = 0.00) against clinic
               controls). Lactose consumption showed no effect while fructose
               intake was negatively associated with risk for IBD (NS). Similar
               trends were noted in UC and CD. A high fat intake was associated
               with an increased risk for UC; this was particularly marked for
               animal fat (OR 4.09, p = 0.02) and cholesterol (OR 4.57, p =
               0.02). A high intake of fluids (p = 0.04), magnesium (p = 0.04),
               vitamin C, and fruits (NS) was negatively associated with the
               risk for IBD, while a positive association was found for retinol
               (p = 0.01). Most of the findings were similar in UC and CD
               except for potassium and vegetable consumption which showed a
               negative association only with risk for CD. CONCLUSIONS: An
               association was found between pre-illness diet and subsequent
               development of UC and CD. The effect of dietary components may
               be primary or modulatory.",

               disease 2019 (Covid-19). Genomewide association analysis may
               allow for the identification of potential genetic factors
               involved in the development of Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a
               genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with
               Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at
               seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the
               SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. After quality control and the
               exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control
               participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control
               participants from Spain were included in the final analysis. In
               total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
               conducted a meta-analysis of the two case-control panels.
               RESULTS: We detected cross-replicating associations with
               rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2,
               which were significant at the genomewide level (P<5$\times$10-8)
               in the meta-analysis of the two case-control panels (odds ratio,
               1.77; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P =
               1.15$\times$10-10; and odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.47;
               P = 4.95$\times$10-8, respectively). At locus 3p21.31, the
               association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9,
               FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1. The association signal at locus 9q34.2
               coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a
               blood-group-specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood
               group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95\% CI,
               1.20 to 1.75; P = 1.48$\times$10-4) and a protective effect in
               blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio,
               0.65; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P = 1.06$\times$10-5). CONCLUSIONS:
               We identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility
               locus in patients with Covid-19 with respiratory failure and
               confirmed a potential involvement of the ABO blood-group system.

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Several reports have identified different patterns
               of Parkinson's disease progression in individuals carrying
               missense variants in GBA or LRRK2 genes. The overall
               contribution of genetic factors to the severity and progression
               of Parkinson's disease, however, has not been well studied.
               OBJECTIVES: To test the association between genetic variants and
               the clinical features of Parkinson's disease on a genomewide
               scale. METHODS: We accumulated individual data from 12
               longitudinal cohorts in a total of 4093 patients with 22,307
               observations for a median of 3.81 years. Genomewide associations
               were evaluated for 25 cross-sectional and longitudinal
               phenotypes. Specific variants of interest, including 90 recently
               identified disease-risk variants, were also investigated post
               hoc for candidate associations with these phenotypes. RESULTS:
               Two variants were genomewide significant. Rs382940(T>A), within
               the intron of SLC44A1, was associated with reaching Hoehn and
               Yahr stage 3 or higher faster (hazard ratio 2.04 [1.58-2.62]; P
               value = 3.46E-8). Rs61863020(G>A), an intergenic variant and
               expression quantitative trait loci for $\alpha$-2A adrenergic
               receptor, was associated with a lower prevalence of insomnia at
               baseline (odds ratio 0.63 [0.52-0.75]; P value = 4.74E-8). In
               the targeted analysis, we found 9 associations between known
               Parkinson's risk variants and more severe motor/cognitive
               symptoms. Also, we replicated previous reports of GBA coding
               variants (rs2230288: p.E365K; rs75548401: p.T408M) being
               associated with greater motor and cognitive decline over time,
               and an APOE E4 tagging variant (rs429358) being associated with
               greater cognitive deficits in patients. CONCLUSIONS: We
               identified novel genetic factors associated with heterogeneity
               of Parkinson's disease. The results can be used for validation
               or hypothesis tests regarding Parkinson's disease. \copyright{}

              their lifetime. Indications for surgical intervention include
              obstruction, intra-abdominal or perianal abscess, enterocutaneous
              fistulas, and complex perianal disease. As medical therapies
              continue to improve, it is important that surgical therapies are
              chosen carefully. This is particularly important in the treatment
              of perianal fistulas; combined surgical and medical therapy offer
              the best chance for success. In the treatment of small-bowel
              disease, bowel preservation is key. For the repair of short
              strictures, endoscopic dilatation is the preferred method when
              accessible; strictureplasty has been shown to be safe and
              effective for increasingly longer segments of disease.
              Intra-abdominal abscesses should be drained percutaneously, if
              possible. In the presence of colonic disease, segmental resection
              is recommended. Unfortunately, refractory disease still
              frequently requires complete proctectomy and permanent diversion.",

               databases to identify all relevant studies, and study-specific
               relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were
               pooled using a random-effects model. Sixteen studies were
               identified with a total of 130,431 participants and 1933 CD
               cases. No significant association was detected between alcohol
               intake and CD risk (RR for the highest vs the lowest consumption
               level: 0.85, 95\% CI 0.68-1.08), and coffee intake and the risk
               (RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.46-1.46). High intake of soft drinks was
               associated with CD risk (RR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.01-1.98), and tea
               intake was inversely associated with CD risk (RR 0.70, 95\% CI
               0.53-0.93). In conclusion, high intake of soft drinks might
               increase the risk of CD, whereas tea intake might decrease the
               risk.",

               included adult patients with IBD, with recorded body mass index
               (BMI), with at least 6 months of follow-up, excluding patients
               with BMI < 18.5 kg/m. We evaluated the independent effect of

               established IBD, these lifestyle factors may significantly
               impact the natural history and clinical outcomes. Recreational
               exercise decreases the risk of flare and fatigue in patients
               with IBD. In contrast, obesity increases the risk of relapse and
               is associated with higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain
               and higher health care utilization. Obesity also modifies
               pharmacokinetics of biologic agents unfavorably and is
               associated with a higher risk of treatment failure. Sleep
               disturbance is highly prevalent in patients with IBD,
               independent of disease activity, and increases the risk of
               relapse and chronic fatigue. Similarly, stress, particularly
               perceived stress rather than major life events, may trigger
               symptomatic flare in patients with IBD, although its impact on
               inflammation is unclear. Cigarette smoking is associated with
               unfavorable outcomes including the risk of corticosteroid
               dependence, surgery, and disease progression in patients with
               Crohn's disease; in contrast, smoking does not significantly

               lifestyle factors are potentially modifiable, only a few
               interventional studies have been conducted. Trials of structured
               exercise and psychological therapy including mindfulness-based
               therapies such as meditation and yoga and gut-directed
               hypnotherapy have not consistently demonstrated benefit in

               to determine risk factors that might contribute to the
               development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Recent studies have
               focused on the role of appendectomy in the disease's
               pathogenesis. This report aims to review and analyze the degree
               of evidence from recent published studies. METHODS: Medline and
               Embase databases were scrutinized for studies published between
               1987 and January 1999. Reference lists from published articles,
               reviews, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal (GI) meetings
               were also reviewed. All studies specifically designed to
               evaluate the association between appendectomy and UC were
               selected. Thirteen studies that satisfied our selection criteria
               were evaluated by metaanalysis. RESULTS: The 13 case-control
               studies collectively gathered evidence from 2770 patients with
               UC and 3352 controls. Combining the results of the individual
               studies gave an overall odds ratio of 0.307 (95\% confidence
               interval [CI] = 0.249-0.377) in favor of appendectomy (p0.10).
               The influence of potential confounding factors (mainly smoking)
               on these results could be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: The review of
               the literature and the metaanalysis of the selected studies
               suggest that the inverse association between appendectomy and UC
               is strong and consistent. Further studies are needed to
               establish whether a causal relationship exists.",

               implicated to date in the development of Crohn's disease (CD)

               provide a quantification of the risk of oral contraceptive pill
               (OCP) use in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
               METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify
               comparative studies reporting on the association of oral
               contraceptive use in the etiology of UC and CD between 1983 and
               2007. A random-effect meta-analysis was used to compare the
               incidence of UC or CD between the patients exposed to the OCP
               and nonexposed patients. The results were adjusted for smoking.
               RESULTS: A total of 75,815 patients were reported on by 14
               studies, with 36,797 exposed to OCP and 39,018 nonexposed women.
               The pooled relative risk (RR) for CD for women currently taking
               the OCP was 1.51 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.96, P=
               0.002), and 1.46 (95\% CI 1.26-1.70, P < 0.001), adjusted for
               smoking. The RR for UC in women currently taking the OCP was
               1.53 (95\% CI 1.21-1.94, P= 0.001), and 1.28 (95\% CI 1.06-1.54,
               P= 0.011), adjusted for smoking. The RR for CD increased with
               the length of exposure to OCP. Moreover, although the RR did not
               reduce once the OCP was stopped, it was no longer significant
               once the OCP was stopped (CI contains 1), both for CD and for
               UC. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of an association
               between the use of oral contraceptive agents and development of
               IBD, in particular CD. The study also suggests that the risk for
               patients who stop using the OCP reverts to that of the

               non-smokers, in which nicotine is of therapeutic value. The mode

               immunocytochemistry (ICC) were used to show alpha3 nAChRs in
               colonic mucosa. Rectal mucosa was examined from controls (n=55)
               and patients with inactive UC (n=62), both smokers and
               non-smokers, by ICC, using two antibodies to show the density
               and distribution of receptors in the mucosa. Non-smokers with UC
               (n=43) were given transdermal nicotine or placebo patches for 6
               months, and rectal biopsies, taken before and after treatment,
               were examined by ICC to show nAChRs. RESULTS: In normal colon,
               ISH and ICC showed alpha3 subunit in a wide variety of cells,
               including mucosal epithelium. In rectal biopsies, neither
               smoking nor nicotine influenced the expression of alpha3
               immunoreactivity in epithelium, either in controls or UC.
               However, controls had a significantly greater density of
               immunodetectable mucosal epithelium alpha3 subunit, compared
               with UC patients. DISCUSSION: The presence of nAChRs in colonic
               epithelium may be pertinent to the beneficial effect of nicotine
               in UC, but since neither smoking nor nicotine treatment is
               associated with any change in the expression of epithelial
               alpha3 nAChRs, the effect may be due to functional changes in
               the receptor. The decreased number of alpha3 nAChRs in UC
               compared with controls may be related to an increased cell
               turnover in UC.",

               range of conditions generally grouped into Crohn's disease (CD)
               or ulcerative colitis (UC) based on clinical, laboratory,
               radiological, endoscopic, and histological criteria. However,
               inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) is used when
               there are clinical and endoscopic signs of chronic colitis
               without specific features of UC or CD but features of both.
               Conjecture exists regarding IBDU, especially in children, as to
               whether it represents a unique childhood phenotype or whether it
               reflects the difficulties in assigning an IBD subtype at an
               early age. SUMMARY: This review examines the current
               understanding of pediatric IBDU and assesses the evidence
               supporting IBDU as a distinctive disease entity on the spectrum
               of inflammatory bowel disease. KEY MESSAGES: Pediatric-onset
               IBDU is more common than adult-onset IBDU. Therefore, an
               understanding of IBDU in this age group assumes more importance.
               However, there remains a paucity of information and a lack of
               exclusive longitudinal studies on pediatric IBDU. Subsequently
               there is significant disparity in the reported prevalence,
               clinical course, reclassification trends, and treatment
               responses around pediatric IBDU. Therefore, it remains
               challenging to chart the natural history of pediatric IBDU and
               consequently form an accurate understanding of where pediatric
               IBDU sits on the spectrum of disease.",

               of which (39 common and 3 rare variants) are independent of the

               search for, and find, multiple causal variants located in close
               proximity. It has also become standard to ask whether different
               traits share the same causal variants, but one of the popular
               methods to answer this question, coloc, makes the simplifying
               assumption that only a single causal variant exists for any
               given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the
               potential of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE)
               regression framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic
               signals, for use with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that
               allows evidence for association at multiple causal variants to
               be evaluated simultaneously, whilst separating the statistical
               support for each variant conditional on the causal signal being
               considered. We show this results in more accurate coloc
               inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple
               causal variants based on conditioning. We therefore recommend
               that coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise

  abstract  = "Gene expression data, in conjunction with information on genetic
               variants, have enabled studies to identify expression
               quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) or polymorphic locations in the
               genome that are associated with expression levels. Moreover,
               recent technological developments and cost decreases have
               further enabled studies to collect expression data in multiple
               tissues. One advantage of multiple tissue datasets is that
               studies can combine results from different tissues to identify
               eQTLs more accurately than examining each tissue separately. The
               idea of aggregating results of multiple tissues is closely
               related to the idea of meta-analysis which aggregates results of
               multiple genome-wide association studies to improve the power to
               detect associations. In principle, meta-analysis methods can be
               used to combine results from multiple tissues. However, eQTLs
               may have effects in only a single tissue, in all tissues, or in
               a subset of tissues with possibly different effect sizes. This
               heterogeneity in terms of effects across multiple tissues
               presents a key challenge to detect eQTLs. In this paper, we
               develop a framework that leverages two popular meta-analysis
               methods that address effect size heterogeneity to detect eQTLs
               across multiple tissues. We show by using simulations and
               multiple tissue data from mouse that our approach detects many
               eQTLs undetected by traditional eQTL methods. Additionally, our
               method provides an interpretation framework that accurately
               predicts whether an eQTL has an effect in a particular tissue.",

               powerful and widely adopted approach to identifying putative
               regulatory variants and linking them to specific genes. Up to
               now eQTL studies have been conducted in a relatively narrow
               range of tissues or cell types. However, understanding the
               biology of organismal phenotypes will involve understanding
               regulation in multiple tissues, and ongoing studies are
               collecting eQTL data in dozens of cell types. Here we present a
               statistical framework for powerfully detecting eQTLs in multiple
               tissues or cell types (or, more generally, multiple subgroups).
               The framework explicitly models the potential for each eQTL to
               be active in some tissues and inactive in others. By modeling
               the sharing of active eQTLs among tissues, this framework
               increases power to detect eQTLs that are present in more than
               one tissue compared with ``tissue-by-tissue'' analyses that
               examine each tissue separately. Conversely, by modeling the
               inactivity of eQTLs in some tissues, the framework allows the
               proportion of eQTLs shared across different tissues to be
               formally estimated as parameters of a model, addressing the
               difficulties of accounting for incomplete power when comparing
               overlaps of eQTLs identified by tissue-by-tissue analyses.
               Applying our framework to re-analyze data from transformed B
               cells, T cells, and fibroblasts, we find that it substantially
               increases power compared with tissue-by-tissue analysis,
               identifying 63\% more genes with eQTLs (at FDR = 0.05). Further,
               the results suggest that, in contrast to previous analyses of
               the same data, the majority of eQTLs detectable in these data
               are shared among all three tissues.",

               SMN1 ) gene. Alterations within an almost identical copy gene,
               the centromeric survival motor neuron 2 ( SMN2 ) gene produce no
               known phenotypic effect. The exons of the two genes differ by
               just two nucleotides, neither of which alters the encoded amino
               acids. At the genomic level, only five nucleotides that
               differentiate the two genes from one another have been reported.
               The entire genomic sequence of the two genes has not been
               determined. Thus, differences which might explain why SMN1 is
               the SMA gene are not readily apparent. In this study, we have
               completely sequenced and compared genomic clones containing the
               SMN genes. The two genes show striking similarity, with the
               homology being unprecedented between two different yet
               functional genes. The only critical difference in an
               approximately 32 kb region between the two SMN genes is the C->T
               base change 6 bp inside exon 7. This alteration but not other
               variations in the SMN genes affects the splicing pattern of the
               genes. The majority of the transcript from the SMN1 locus is
               full length, whereas the majority of the transcript produced by
               the SMN2 locus lacks exon 7. We suggest that the exon 7
               nucleotide change affects the activity of an exon splice
               enhancer. In SMA patients, the loss of SMN1 but the presence of
               SMN2 results in low levels of full-length SMN transcript and
               therefore low SMN protein levels which causes SMA.",

               required for the expression of most metazoan genes. Members of
               the family of serine/arginine (SR)-rich proteins are critical
               components of the machineries carrying out these essential
               processing events, highlighting their importance in maintaining
               efficient gene expression. SR proteins are characterized by
               their ability to interact simultaneously with RNA and other
               protein components via an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and
               through a domain rich in arginine and serine residues, the RS
               domain. Their functional roles in gene expression are
               surprisingly diverse, ranging from their classical involvement
               in constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing to various
               post-splicing activities, including mRNA nuclear export,
               nonsense-mediated decay, and mRNA translation. These activities

               approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative
               splicing. We previously developed multivariate analysis of
               transcript splicing (MATS), a statistical method for detecting
               differential alternative splicing between two RNA-Seq samples.
               Here we describe a new statistical model and computer program,
               replicate MATS (rMATS), designed for detection of differential
               alternative splicing from replicate RNA-Seq data. rMATS uses a
               hierarchical model to simultaneously account for sampling
               uncertainty in individual replicates and variability among
               replicates. In addition to the analysis of unpaired replicates,
               rMATS also includes a model specifically designed for paired
               replicates between sample groups. The hypothesis-testing
               framework of rMATS is flexible and can assess the statistical
               significance over any user-defined magnitude of splicing change.
               The performance of rMATS is evaluated by the analysis of
               simulated and real RNA-Seq data. rMATS outperformed two existing
               methods for replicate RNA-Seq data in all simulation settings,
               and RT-PCR yielded a high validation rate (94\%) in an RNA-Seq
               dataset of prostate cancer cell lines. Our data also provide
               guiding principles for designing RNA-Seq studies of alternative
               splicing. We demonstrate that it is essential to incorporate
               biological replicates in the study design. Of note, pooling RNAs
               or merging RNA-Seq data from multiple replicates is not an
               effective approach to account for variability, and the result is
               particularly sensitive to outliers. The rMATS source code is
               freely available at rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/. As the
               popularity of RNA-Seq continues to grow, we expect rMATS will be
               useful for studies of alternative splicing in diverse RNA-Seq

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing has opened new avenues for the study
               of transcriptome composition. Significant evidence has
               accumulated showing that the human transcriptome contains in
               excess of a hundred thousand different transcripts. However, it
               is still not clear to what extent this diversity prevails when
               considering the relative abundances of different transcripts
               from the same gene. RESULTS: Here we show that, in a given
               condition, most protein coding genes have one major transcript
               expressed at significantly higher level than others, that in
               human tissues the major transcripts contribute almost 85 percent
               to the total mRNA from protein coding loci, and that often the
               same major transcript is expressed in many tissues. We detect a
               high degree of overlap between the set of major transcripts and
               a recently published set of alternatively spliced transcripts
               that are predicted to be translated utilizing proteomic data.
               Thus, we hypothesize that although some minor transcripts may
               play a functional role, the major ones are likely to be the main
               contributors to the proteome. However, we still detect a
               non-negligible fraction of protein coding genes for which the
               major transcript does not code a protein. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
               our findings suggest that the transcriptome from protein coding
               loci is dominated by one transcript per gene and that not all
               the transcripts that contribute to transcriptome diversity are
               equally likely to contribute to protein diversity. This
               observation can help to prioritize candidate targets in
               proteomics research and to predict the functional impact of the
               detected changes in variation studies.",

               spliced transcripts, it is not clear whether genes tend to
               express a range of transcripts simultaneously across cells, or
               produce dominant isoforms in a manner that is either
               tissue-specific or regardless of tissue. To date, large-scale
               investigations into the pattern of transcript expression across
               distinct tissues have produced contradictory results. Here, we
               attempt to determine whether genes express a dominant splice
               variant at the protein level. We interrogate peptides from eight
               large-scale human proteomics experiments and databases and find
               that there is a single dominant protein isoform, irrespective of
               tissue or cell type, for the vast majority of the protein-coding
               genes in these experiments, in partial agreement with the
               conclusions from the most recent large-scale RNAseq study.
               Remarkably, the dominant isoforms from the experimental
               proteomics analyses coincided overwhelmingly with the reference
               isoforms selected by two completely orthogonal sources, the
               consensus coding sequence variants, which are agreed upon by
               separate manual genome curation teams, and the principal
               isoforms from the APPRIS database, predicted automatically from

               transcripts, has been proposed to underlie morphological
               innovations in multicellular organisms. Genes with developmental
               functions are enriched for alternative splicing events,
               suggestive of a contribution of alternative splicing to
               developmental programmes. The role of alternative splicing as a
               source of transcript diversification has previously been
               compared to that of gene duplication, with the relationship
               between the two extensively explored. Alternative splicing is
               reduced following gene duplication with the retention of
               duplicate copies higher for genes which were alternatively
               spliced prior to duplication. Furthermore, and unlike the case
               for overall gene number, the proportion of alternatively spliced
               genes has also increased in line with the evolutionary
               diversification of cell types, suggesting alternative splicing
               may contribute to the complexity of developmental programmes.
               Together these observations suggest a prominent role for
               alternative splicing as a source of functional innovation.
               However, it is unknown whether the proliferation of alternative

               debate?",
  author    = "Koonin, Eugene V",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Ever since the discovery of 'genes in pieces' and
               mRNA splicing in eukaryotes, origin and evolution of
               spliceosomal introns have been considered within the conceptual
               framework of the 'introns early' versus 'introns late' debate.
               The 'introns early' hypothesis, which is closely linked to the
               so-called exon theory of gene evolution, posits that
               protein-coding genes were interrupted by numerous introns even
               at the earliest stages of life's evolution and that introns
               played a major role in the origin of proteins by facilitating
               recombination of sequences coding for small protein/peptide
               modules. Under this scenario, the absence of spliceosomal
               introns in prokaryotes is considered to be a result of ``genome
               streamlining''. The 'introns late' hypothesis counters that
               spliceosomal introns emerged only in eukaryotes, and moreover,
               have been inserted into protein-coding genes continuously
               throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. Beyond the formal
               dilemma, the more substantial side of this debate has to do with
               possible roles of introns in the evolution of eukaryotes.
               RESULTS: I argue that several lines of evidence now suggest a
               coherent solution to the introns-early versus introns-late
               debate, and the emerging picture of intron evolution integrates
               aspects of both views although, formally, there seems to be no
               support for the original version of introns-early. Firstly,
               there is growing evidence that spliceosomal introns evolved from
               group II self-splicing introns which are present, usually, in
               small numbers, in many bacteria, and probably, moved into the
               evolving eukaryotic genome from the alpha-proteobacterial
               progenitor of the mitochondria. Secondly, the concept of a
               primordial pool of 'virus-like' genetic elements implies that
               self-splicing introns are among the most ancient genetic
               entities. Thirdly, reconstructions of the ancestral state of
               eukaryotic genes suggest that the last common ancestor of extant
               eukaryotes had an intron-rich genome. Thus, it appears that
               ancestors of spliceosomal introns, indeed, have existed since
               the earliest stages of life's evolution, in a formal agreement
               with the introns-early scenario. However, there is no evidence
               that these ancient introns ever became widespread before the
               emergence of eukaryotes, hence, the central tenet of
               introns-early, the role of introns in early evolution of
               proteins, has no support. However, the demonstration that
               numerous introns invaded eukaryotic genes at the outset of
               eukaryotic evolution and that subsequent intron gain has been
               limited in many eukaryotic lineages implicates introns as an
               ancestral feature of eukaryotic genomes and refutes radical
               versions of introns-late. Perhaps, most importantly, I argue
               that the intron invasion triggered other pivotal events of
               eukaryogenesis, including the emergence of the spliceosome, the
               nucleus, the linear chromosomes, the telomerase, and the
               ubiquitin signaling system. This concept of eukaryogenesis, in a
               sense, revives some tenets of the exon hypothesis, by assigning
               to introns crucial roles in eukaryotic evolutionary innovation.
               CONCLUSION: The scenario of the origin and evolution of introns
               that is best compatible with the results of comparative genomics
               and theoretical considerations goes as follows: self-splicing
               introns since the earliest stages of life's evolution--numerous
               spliceosomal introns invading genes of the emerging eukaryote
               during eukaryogenesis--subsequent lineage-specific loss and gain
               of introns. The intron invasion, probably, spawned by the
               mitochondrial endosymbiont, might have critically contributed to
               the emergence of the principal features of the eukaryotic cell.
               This scenario combines aspects of the introns-early and
               introns-late views. REVIEWERS: this article was reviewed by W.

  abstract  = "We examined the gene structure of a set of 2563 Arabidopsis
               thaliana paralogous pairs that were duplicated simultaneously
               20-60 MYA by tetraploidy. Out of a total of 23,164 introns in
               these genes, we found that 10,004 pairs have been conserved and
               578 introns have been inserted or deleted in the time since the
               duplication event. This intron insertion/deletion rate of 2.7 x
               10(-3) to 9.1 x 10(-4) per site per million years is high in
               comparison to previous studies. At least 56 introns were gained
               and 39 lost based on parsimony analysis of the phylogenetic
               distribution of these introns. We found weak evidence that genes
               undergoing intron gain and loss are biased with respect to gene
               ontology terms. Gene pairs that experienced at least 2 intron
               insertions or deletions show evidence of enrichment for membrane
               location and transport and transporter activity function. We do
               not find any relationship of intron flux to expression level or
               G + C content of the gene. Detection of a bias in the location
               of intron gains and losses within a gene depends on the method
               of measurement: an intragene method indicates that events
               (specifically intron losses) are biased toward the 3' end of the
               gene. Despite the relatively recent acquisition of these
               introns, we found only one case where we could identify the
               mechanism of intron origin--the TOUCH3 gene has experienced 2
               tandem, partial, internal gene duplications that duplicated a
               preexisting intron and also created a novel, alternatively
               spliced intron that makes use of a duplicated pair of cryptic
               splice sites.",

               genomes, yet the major drivers of intron content during
               evolution remain elusive. Rapid intron loss and gain in some
               lineages contrast with long-term evolutionary stasis in others.
               Episodic intron gain could be explained by recently discovered
               specialized transposons called Introners, but so far Introners
               are only known from a handful of species. Here, we performed a
               systematic search across 3,325 eukaryotic genomes and identified
               27,563 Introner-derived introns in 175 genomes (5.2\%). Species
               with Introners span remarkable phylogenetic diversity, from
               animals to basal protists, representing lineages whose last
               common ancestor dates to over 1.7 billion years ago. Aquatic
               organisms were 6.5 times more likely to contain Introners than
               terrestrial organisms. Introners exhibit mechanistic diversity
               but most are consistent with DNA transposition, indicating that
               Introners have evolved convergently hundreds of times from
               nonautonomous transposable elements. Transposable elements and
               aquatic taxa are associated with high rates of horizontal gene
               transfer, suggesting that this combination of factors may
               explain the punctuated and biased diversity of species
               containing Introners. More generally, our data suggest that
               Introners may explain the episodic nature of intron gain across
               the eukaryotic tree of life. These results illuminate the major
               source of ongoing intron creation in eukaryotic genomes.",

               excision proceeds in two successive transesterification
               reactions. Important elements for catalysis are the RNA moieties

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: As the third leading cause of death in the United
               States, the impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
               (COPD) makes identification of its molecular mechanisms of great
               importance. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have
               identified multiple genomic regions associated with COPD.
               However, genetic variation only explains a small fraction of the
               susceptibility to COPD, and sub-genome-wide significant loci may
               play a role in pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: Regulatory annotation
               with epigenetic evidence may give priority for further
               investigation, particularly for GWAS associations in noncoding
               regions. We performed integrative genomics analyses using DNA
               methylation profiling and genome-wide SNP genotyping from lung
               tissue samples from 90 subjects with COPD and 36 control
               subjects. METHODS: We performed methylation quantitative trait
               loci (mQTL) analyses, testing for SNPs associated with percent
               DNA methylation and assessed the colocalization of these results
               with previous COPD GWAS findings using Bayesian methods in the R
               package coloc to highlight potential regulatory features of the
               loci. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 942,068
               unique SNPs and 33,996 unique CpG sites among the significant
               (5\% false discovery rate) cis-mQTL results. The genome-wide
               significant and subthreshold (P < 10-4) GWAS SNPs were enriched
               in the significant mQTL SNPs (hypergeometric test P < 0.00001).
               We observed enrichment for sites located in CpG shores and
               shelves, but not CpG islands. Using Bayesian colocalization, we
               identified loci in regions near KCNK3, EEFSEC, PIK3CD, DCDC2C,
               TCERG1L, FRMD4B, and IL27. CONCLUSIONS: Colocalization of mQTL
               and GWAS loci provides regulatory characterization of
               significant and subthreshold GWAS findings, supporting a role
               for genetic control of methylation in COPD pathogenesis.",

               brain mQTLs. Fetal brain mQTLs were primarily cis-acting,
               enriched in regulatory chromatin domains and transcription
               factor binding sites, and showed substantial overlap with
               genetic variants that were also associated with gene expression
               in the brain. Using tissue from three distinct regions of the
               adult brain (prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum), we
               found that most fetal brain mQTLs were developmentally stable,
               although a subset was characterized by fetal-specific effects.
               Fetal brain mQTLs were enriched amongst risk loci identified in
               a recent large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of
               schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder with a hypothesized
               neurodevelopmental component. Finally, we found that mQTLs can
               be used to refine GWAS loci through the identification of
               discrete sites of variable fetal brain methylation associated
               with schizophrenia risk variants.",

               identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is

               which genetic variation leads to gene expression differences
               among humans. We used DNase I sequencing to measure chromatin
               accessibility in 70 Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which
               genome-wide genotypes and estimates of gene expression levels
               are also available. We obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely
               mapped DNase I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to
               produce genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility for each

               polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In conventional epidemiology confounding of the
               exposure of interest with lifestyle or socioeconomic factors,
               and reverse causation whereby disease status influences exposure
               rather than vice versa, may invalidate causal interpretations of
               observed associations. Conversely, genetic variants should not
               be related to the confounding factors that distort associations
               in conventional observational epidemiological studies.
               Furthermore, disease onset will not influence genotype.
               Therefore, it has been suggested that genetic variants that are
               known to be associated with a modifiable (nongenetic) risk
               factor can be used to help determine the causal effect of this
               modifiable risk factor on disease outcomes. This approach,
               mendelian randomization, is increasingly being applied within
               epidemiological studies. However, there is debate about the
               underlying premise that associations between genotypes and
               disease outcomes are not confounded by other risk factors. We
               examined the extent to which genetic variants, on the one hand,
               and nongenetic environmental exposures or phenotypic
               characteristics on the other, tend to be associated with each
               other, to assess the degree of confounding that would exist in
               conventional epidemiological studies compared with mendelian
               randomization studies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated
               pairwise correlations between nongenetic baseline variables and
               genetic variables in a cross-sectional study comparing the
               number of correlations that were statistically significant at
               the 5\%, 1\%, and 0.01\% level (alpha = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.0001,
               respectively) with the number expected by chance if all
               variables were in fact uncorrelated, using a two-sided binomial
               exact test. We demonstrate that behavioural, socioeconomic, and
               physiological factors are strongly interrelated, with 45\% of
               all possible pairwise associations between 96 nongenetic
               characteristics (n = 4,560 correlations) being significant at
               the p < 0.01 level (the ratio of observed to expected
               significant associations was 45; p-value for difference between
               observed and expected < 0.000001). Similar findings were
               observed for other levels of significance. In contrast, genetic
               variants showed no greater association with each other, or with
               the 96 behavioural, socioeconomic, and physiological factors,
               than would be expected by chance. CONCLUSIONS: These data
               illustrate why observational studies have produced misleading
               claims regarding potentially causal factors for disease. The
               findings demonstrate the potential power of a methodology that
               utilizes genetic variants as indicators of exposure level when
               studying environmentally modifiable risk factors.",

               on accurate sequences or genotypes. However, in applications of
               the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not
               be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or
               somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the
               development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with
               uncertainty. RESULTS: We present a statistical framework for
               calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring
               population genetical parameters and performing association tests
               directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or
               linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our
               method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for
               estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency
               spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the
               necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic
               mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events,
               mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

               these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool

               thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can

                 genetic variants now becoming common. Studies on this scale
                 provide logistical and analytic challenges starting with the
                 issue of efficiently storing, transmitting, and accessing
                 underlying data. Here we present a binary file format (the
                 BGEN format) that can store both directly-typed and
                 statistically imputed genotype data, and achieves substantial
                 space savings by data compression and the use of an efficient
                 representation for probabilities. We investigate the
                 properties of this format using imputed data from the UK
                 BiLEVE study, demonstrating both storage efficiency, and fast
                 data loading performance on the order of hundreds of millions
                 of imputed genotypes per second. To make using BGEN as easy as
                 possible, we provide a detailed specification and a freely

                 developing additional tools including an indexing tool

               Previously, we had identified two genes that cause a subset of
               autosomal recessive forms of this disease: DLL3 (SCD1) and MESP2
               (SCD2). These genes are important components of the Notch

               identify a mutation in a third Notch pathway gene, LUNATIC
               FRINGE (LFNG), in a family with autosomal recessive SCD. LFNG
               encodes a glycosyltransferase that modifies the Notch family of
               cell-surface receptors, a key step in the regulation of this
               signaling pathway. A missense mutation was identified in a
               highly conserved phenylalanine close to the active site of the
               enzyme. Functional analysis revealed that the mutant LFNG was
               not localized to the correct compartment of the cell, was unable
               to modulate Notch signaling in a cell-based assay, and was
               enzymatically inactive. This represents the first known mutation
               in the human LFNG gene and reinforces the hypothesis that proper
               regulation of the Notch signaling pathway is an absolute

               ofLfngactivity between ON and OFF states in the presomitic
               mesoderm prior to somite segmentation are critical for proper
               somite patterning, and suggest that Notch signaling might not be
               the only determinant of cyclic gene expression in the presomitic
               mesoderm of mouse embryos.",

  abstract  = "Pre-mRNA splicing factors play a fundamental role in regulating
               transcript diversity both temporally and spatially. Genetic
               defects in several spliceosome components have been linked to a
               set of non-overlapping spliceosomopathy phenotypes in humans,
               among which skeletal developmental defects and non-syndromic
               retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are frequent findings. Here we report
               that defects in spliceosome-associated protein CWC27 are
               associated with a spectrum of disease phenotypes ranging from
               isolated RP to severe syndromic forms. By whole-exome
               sequencing, recessive protein-truncating mutations in CWC27 were
               found in seven unrelated families that show a range of clinical
               phenotypes, including retinal degeneration, brachydactyly,
               craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, and neurological
               defects. Remarkably, variable expressivity of the human
               phenotype can be recapitulated in Cwc27 mutant mouse models,
               with significant embryonic lethality and severe phenotypes in
               the complete knockout mice while mice with a partial

               a fistulectomy and a fistulotomy with marsupialization in the
               management of a simple anal fistula. METHODS: Forty patients
               with simple anal fistula were randomized into two groups.
               Fistulous tracts were managed by using a fistulectomy (group A)
               while a fistulotomy with marsupialization was performed in group
               B. The primary outcome measure was wound healing time while
               secondary outcome measures were operating time, postoperative
               wound size, postoperative pain, wound infection, anal
               incontinence, recurrence and patient satisfaction. RESULTS:
               Postoperative wounds in group B healed earlier in comparison to
               group A wounds (4.85 $\pm$ 1.39 weeks vs. 6.75 $\pm$ 1.83 weeks,
               P = 0.035). No significant differences existed between the
               operating times (28.00 $\pm$ 6.35 minutes vs. 28.20 $\pm$ 6.57
               minutes, P = 0.925) and visual analogue scale scores for
               postoperative pain on the first postoperative day (4.05 $\pm$
               1.47 vs. 4.50 $\pm$ 1.32, P = 0.221) for the two groups.
               Postoperative wounds were larger in group A than in group B
               (2.07 $\pm$ 0.1.90 cm(2) vs. 1.23 $\pm$ 0.87 cm(2)), however
               this difference did not reach statistical significance (P =
               0.192). Wound discharge was observed for a significantly longer
               duration in group A than in group B (4.10 $\pm$ 1.91 weeks vs.
               2.75 $\pm$ 1.71 weeks, P = 0.035). There were no differences in
               social and sexual activities after surgery between the patients
               of the two groups. No patient developed anal incontinence or
               recurrence during the follow-up period of twelve weeks.
               CONCLUSION: In comparison to a fistulectomy, a fistulotomy with
               marsupialization results in faster healing and a shorter
               duration of wound discharge without increasing the operating
               time.",

               results of fistulotomy and sphincter reconstruction for the
               treatment of complex fistula-in-ano. BACKGROUND: Complex
               fistula-in-ano is difficult to treat due to the occurrence of
               postoperative anal incontinence and the high rate of recurrence.
               METHODS: Seventy patients who were diagnosed with complex
               fistula-in-ano and underwent fistulotomy and sphincter
               reconstruction between October 2000 and October 2006 were
               analyzed in the present study. Preoperative assessment included
               physical examination, anorectal manometry, and anal
               endosonography. Appointments were scheduled every 6 months
               during the first and second year of treatment and every 2 years
               thereafter. Recurrence and incontinence were evaluated during
               each visit. Continence was assessed according to the Wexner
               continence grading scale. Anal manometry was performed 3 and 12
               months after treatment and every 2 years thereafter. Anal
               endosonography was conducted 6 months after treatment. RESULTS:
               Fistulas were classified as medium-high trans-sphincteric in 64
               patients (91.42\%) and were recurrent in 22 patients (32\%).
               Before surgery, 22 patients (32\%) reported fecal incontinence,
               which improved after surgery in 15 cases (70\%), from 6.75 to
               1.88 (P < 0.005) on the Wexner Scale. Eight preoperative
               continent patients (16.6\%) reported postoperative incontinence
               (Wexner Score < 3), and 6 patients (8.5\%) had recurrent
               incontinence. Among these patients, 2 developed recurrent
               incontinence 6 months after treatment, 2 developed recurrent
               incontinence 1 year after treatment, 1 developed recurrent
               incontinence 2 years after treatment, and 1 developed
               incontinence 5 years after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulotomy
               with sphincter reconstruction is an effective technique for the
               treatment of complex fistula-in-ano. Continence and anal
               manometry results were improved in incontinent patients and were
               not jeopardized in continent ones. Fistulotomy with sphincter
               reconstruction is an especially suitable technique for
               incontinent patients with recurrent fistulas.",

               fistula-in-ano is generally considered to be relatively
               uncommon. Nevertheless, no comprehensive analysis of its
               incidence in developed countries is available. Our goal was to
               determine the actual incidence of fistula-in-ano based on the
               study of incidence in four countries of the European Union (EU).
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a search of hospital
               inpatient databases in five different countries. We obtained
               valid data from four European countries, namely, England (UK;
               Hospital Episodes Statistics), Germany (German hospitals'
               databases), Italy (Scheda di Dimissione Ospedaliera), and Spain
               (Conjunto M{\'\i}nimo B{\'a}sico de Datos by Insalud-Spanish
               National Health Institute). RESULTS: The incidence of
               fistula-in-ano varied among the different populations in the EU.
               In the four countries examined, it ranged from 1.04 per
               10,000/year in Spain to 2.32 per 10,000/year in Italy. A
               statistical comparison of rates from the different countries
               studied gives a confidence interval from 1.20 up to 2.80. The
               population that we studied represents almost 51\% of the total
               population of the EU. CONCLUSION: This study attempts to
               determine the actual incidence of fistula-in-ano in the European
               Community, which was previously uncertain despite its major
               negative effects on quality of life and the high cost of
               treatment. Our findings indicate that the incidence of
               fistula-in-ano in the four countries of the EU studied is
               significantly higher than that in the only previously published
               report of the incidence of fistula-in-ano in Europe.
               Nevertheless, our findings confirm the general perception that
               fistula-in-ano is a relatively uncommon disease.",

               typically defined as a pathological communication between two
               epithelialized surfaces. More specifically, perianal fistula
               manifests as an abnormal tract between the anorectal canal and
               the perianal skin. Perianal fistulas are often characterized by
               significantly decreased patient quality of life. The
               cryptoglandular theory of perianal fistulas suggests their
               development from the proctodeal glands, which originate from the
               intersphincteric plane and perforate the internal sphincter with
               their ducts. Involvement of proctodeal glands in the
               inflammatory process could play a primary role in the formation

               summarize and assess the credibility of evidence of potential
               risk factors for anal fistula recurrence (AFR) after surgery.
               METHODS: Pubmed and EMBASE without language restriction were
               searched from inception to April 2018 that reported risk factors
               which predisposed recurrence after anal fistula surgery. We
               excluded studies that involved patients with anal fistula
               associated with Crohn's disease. MOOSE guidelines were followed
               when this meta-analysis was performed. We used random-effects
               models to pool relative risks (RRs) with 95\% confidence
               intervals (CIs). Evidence from observational studies was graded
               into high-quality (Class I), moderate-quality (Class II/III) and
               low-quality (Class IV) based on Egger's P value, total sample
               size and between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 3514 citations
               screened, 20 unique observational studies comprising 6168
               patients were involved in data synthesis. High-quality evidence
               showed that AFR was associated with high transsphincteric
               fistula (RR, 4.77; 95\% CI, 3.83 to 5.95), internal opening
               unidentified (RR, 8.54; 95\% CI, 5.29 to 13.80), and horseshoe
               extensions (RR, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.43 to 2.59). Moderate-quality
               evidence suggested an association with prior anal surgery (RR,
               1.52; 95\% CI, 1.04 to 2.23), seton placement surgery (RR, 2.97;
               95\% CI, 1.10 to 8.06), and multiple fistula tract (RR, 4.77;
               95\% CI, 1.46 to 15.51). High-quality evidence demonstrated no
               significant association with gender or smoking; moderate-quality
               evidence also suggested no association with age, tertiary
               referral, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, obesity, preoperative
               seton drainage, high internal opening, postoperative drainage,
               mucosal advancement flap surgery, supralevator extensions,
               location or type of anal fistula. CONCLUSION: Several patient,
               surgery and fistula-related factors are significantly associated
               with postoperative AFR. These findings strengthen clinical
               awareness of early warning to identify patients with high-risk
               disease recurrence for AFR.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Anal fissure (AF) is regarded as a common problem,
               but there are no published epidemiologic data, nor information
               on current treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine
               the incidence, associated comorbidities, and treatment of AF in
               a population-based cohort. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective
               analysis of all persons who were enrolled in one large regional
               managed care system and treated for AF during calendar years
               2005-2011. All persons aged 6 years or older who had a clinic,
               hospitalization, or surgical procedure associated with AF were
               identified from utilization data. To identify comorbidities
               associated with AF, each case was matched by age and gender to 3
               controls. RESULTS: There were 1,243 AF cases, including 721
               (58\%) females and 522 (42\%) males; 150 (12\%) of the cases
               occurred in children aged 6-17 years. The overall annual
               incidence was 0.11\% (1.1 cases per 1000 person-years), but
               ranged widely by age [0.05\% in patients 6-17 years to 0.18\% in
               patients 25-34 years]. The incidence also varied by sex, and was
               significantly higher among females 12-24 years, and among males
               55-64 years (P < 0.001). Comorbidities associated with AF
               included chronic constipation (prevalence 14.2\% vs 3.6\%),
               hypothyroidism (14.7\% vs 10.4\%), obesity (13.0\% vs 7.7\%),
               and solid tumors without metastasis (5.2\% vs 3.7\%) (P < 0.001
               for all comparisons). A total of 448 were dispensed a topical
               prescription medication, 31 had botulinum toxin injection, and
               only 13 had lateral internal sphincterotomy. CONCLUSIONS: AF is
               a common clinical problem, and the incidence varies
               substantially by age and sex. Constipation, obesity, and
               hypothyroidism are associated comorbidities. Most patients are
               prescribed topical treatments, although it appears that many
               prescriptions are never filled. Surgical interventions for AF
               including botulinum toxin and lateral internal sphincterotomy
               are uncommon.",

  abstract  = "Anal fistula is among the most common illnesses affecting man.
               Medical literature dating back to 400 BC has discussed this
               problem. Various causative factors have been proposed throughout
               the centuries, but it appears that the majority of fistulas
               unrelated to specific causes (e.g. Tuberculosis, Crohn's
               disease) result from infection (abscess) in anal glands
               extending from the intersphincteric plane to various anorectal
               spaces. The tubular structure of an anal fistula easily yields
               itself to division or unroofing (fistulotomy) or excision
               (fistulectomy) in most cases. The problem with this single, yet
               effective, treatment plan is that depending on the thickness of
               sphincter muscle the fistula transgresses, the patient will have
               varying degrees of fecal incontinence from minor to total. In an
               attempt to preserve continence, various procedures have been
               proposed to deal with the fistulas. These include: (1) simple
               drainage (Seton); (2) closure of fistula tract using fibrin
               sealant or anal fistula plug; (3) closure of primary opening
               using endorectal or dermal flaps, and more recently; and (4)
               ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT). In most
               complex cases (i.e. Crohn's disease), a proximal fecal diversion
               offers a measure of symptomatic relief. The fact remains that an
               ``ideal'' procedure for anal fistula remains elusive. The
               failure of each sphincter-preserving procedure (30\%-50\%
               recurrence) often results in multiple operations. In essence,
               the price of preservation of continence at all cost is multiple
               and often different operations, prolonged disability and
               disappointment for the patient and the surgeon. Nevertheless,
               the surgeon treating anal fistulas on an occasional basis should
               never hesitate in referring the patient to a specialist.
               Conversely, an expert colorectal surgeon must be familiar with
               many different operations in order to selectively tailor an
               operation to the individual patient.",

  abstract  = "Phylogenetics is a powerful tool for analyzing protein
               sequences, by inferring their evolutionary relationships to
               other proteins. However, phylogenetics analyses can be
               challenging: they are computationally expensive and must be
               performed carefully in order to avoid systematic errors and
               artifacts. Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships
               (PANTHER; http://pantherdb.org) is a publicly available,
               user-focused knowledgebase that stores the results of an
               extensive phylogenetic reconstruction pipeline that includes
               computational and manual processes and quality control steps.
               First, fully reconciled phylogenetic trees (including ancestral
               protein sequences) are reconstructed for a set of ``reference''
               protein sequences obtained from fully sequenced genomes of
               organisms across the tree of life. Second, the resulting
               phylogenetic trees are manually reviewed and annotated with
               function evolution events: inferred gains and losses of protein
               function along branches of the phylogenetic tree. Here, we
               describe in detail the current contents of PANTHER, how those
               contents are generated, and how they can be used in a variety of
               applications. The PANTHER knowledgebase can be downloaded or
               accessed via an extensive API. In addition, PANTHER provides
               software tools to facilitate the application of the
               knowledgebase to common protein sequence analysis tasks:
               exploring an annotated genome by gene function; performing
               ``enrichment analysis'' of lists of genes; annotating a single
               sequence or large batch of sequences by homology; and assessing
               the likelihood that a genetic variant at a particular site in a
               protein will have deleterious effects.",

               admixture linkage disequilibrium. Our results indicate that most
               genetic admixtures occurred between 2,400 and 310 years ago and
               show the admixture proportions to be highly correlated with
               geographic locations, with the highest admixture proportions
               observed in Central Asia and the lowest in East Asia and
               Northwestern Europe. Interestingly, we observed a North-to-South
               decline of European gene flow in East Asians, suggesting a
               northern path of European gene flow diffusing into East Asian
               populations. Our findings contribute to an improved
               understanding of the history of human migration and the
               evolutionary mechanisms that have shaped the genetic structure
               of populations in Eurasia.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Haemorrhoidal disease (HEM) affects a large and
               silently suffering fraction of the population but its aetiology,
               including suspected genetic predisposition, is poorly
               understood. We report the first genome-wide association study
               (GWAS) meta-analysis to identify genetic risk factors for HEM to
               date. DESIGN: We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of 218 920
               patients with HEM and 725 213 controls of European ancestry.
               Using GWAS summary statistics, we performed multiple genetic
               correlation analyses between HEM and other traits as well as
               calculated HEM polygenic risk scores (PRS) and evaluated their
               translational potential in independent datasets. Using
               functional annotation of GWAS results, we identified HEM
               candidate genes, which differential expression and coexpression
               in HEM tissues were evaluated employing RNA-seq analyses. The
               localisation of expressed proteins at selected loci was
               investigated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We demonstrate
               modest heritability and genetic correlation of HEM with several
               other diseases from the GI, neuroaffective and cardiovascular
               domains. HEM PRS validated in 180 435 individuals from
               independent datasets allowed the identification of those at risk
               and correlated with younger age of onset and recurrent surgery.
               We identified 102 independent HEM risk loci harbouring genes
               whose expression is enriched in blood vessels and GI tissues,
               and in pathways associated with smooth muscles, epithelial and
               endothelial development and morphogenesis. Network
               transcriptomic analyses highlighted HEM gene coexpression
               modules that are relevant to the development and integrity of
               the musculoskeletal and epidermal systems, and the organisation
               of the extracellular matrix. CONCLUSION: HEM has a genetic
               component that predisposes to smooth muscle, epithelial and
               connective tissue dysfunction.",

               functions is especially important, but the precise mechanism
               remains elusive. Previously, we identified junctional
               Rab13-binding protein (JRAB)/molecules interacting with

               maturation of cell-cell adhesion sites. These results suggest
               that Rab13 and JRAB regulate reorganization of the actin

               likely part of a larger region of linkage disequilibrium. This

               the reported association rather than the reported SNP itself.

               primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To
               investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis-
               and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses
               using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through
               the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88\% of genes,
               and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL
               (detected for 37\% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested)
               showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication
               power and confounding by cell type composition. However,
               replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized
               intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via
               several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by
               transcription factors. Expression of 13\% of the genes
               correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes,
               pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this
               work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as
               a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex

               expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), thus suggesting that
               most risk variants alter gene expression. However, because
               causal variants are difficult to identify, and cis-eQTLs occur
               frequently, it remains challenging to identify specific
               instances of disease-relevant changes to gene regulation. Here,
               we used a novel joint likelihood framework with higher
               resolution than that of previous methods to identify loci where
               autoimmune-disease risk and an eQTL are driven by a single

  abstract = "AbstractMost signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
              complex traits point to noncoding genetic variants with putative
              gene regulatory effects. However, currently identified expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a small fraction of
              GWAS signals. By analyzing GWAS hits for complex traits in the UK
              Biobank, and cis-eQTLs from the GTEx consortium, we show that
              these assays systematically discover different types of genes and
              variants: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites,
              while GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in
              numerous functional annotations, are under strong selective
              constraint and have a complex regulatory landscape across
              different tissue/cell types, while genes near eQTLs are depleted
              of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have
              simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand
              these observations, including how natural selection on complex
              traits hinders discovery of functionally-relevant eQTLs. Our
              results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically
              biased toward different types of variants, and support the use of
              complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation

               RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) sense viral RNA and signal through
               the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor MAVS (also known
               as IPS-1, Cardif and VISA) whose activation triggers a rapid
               production of type I interferons (IFN) and of pro-inflammatory
               cytokines through the transcription factors IRF3/IRF7 and
               NF-$\kappa$B, respectively. While MAVS is essential for this
               signaling and known to operate through the scaffold protein NEMO
               and the protein kinase TBK1 that phosphorylates IRF3, its
               mechanism of action and regulation remain unclear. RESULTS: We
               report here that RLR activation triggers MAVS ubiquitination on
               lysine 7 and 10 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and marks it
               for proteasomal degradation concomitantly with downstream
               signaling. Inhibition of this MAVS degradation with a proteasome
               inhibitor does not affect NF-$\kappa$B signaling but it hampers
               IRF3 activation, and NEMO and TBK1, two essential mediators in
               type I IFN production, are retained at the mitochondria.
               CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MAVS functions as a
               recruitment platform that assembles a signaling complex
               involving NEMO and TBK1, and that the proteasome-mediated MAVS
               degradation is required to release the signaling complex into
               the cytosol, allowing IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1.",

               defense against bacterial and viral pathogens. Macrophages are
               key innate immune cells that upon encountering
               pathogen-associated molecular patterns respond by producing
               cytokines, including IFN-$\beta$. In this study, we identify a
               novel role for RIPK1 and RIPK3, a pair of homologous
               serine/threonine kinases previously implicated in the regulation
               of necroptosis and pathologic tissue injury, in directing
               IFN-$\beta$ production in macrophages. Using genetic and
               pharmacologic tools, we show that catalytic activity of RIPK1
               directs IFN-$\beta$ synthesis induced by LPS in mice.
               Additionally, we report that RIPK1 kinase-dependent IFN-$\beta$
               production may be elicited in an analogous fashion using LPS in
               bone marrow-derived macrophages upon inhibition of caspases.
               Notably, this regulation requires kinase activities of both
               RIPK1 and RIPK3, but not the necroptosis effector protein, MLKL.
               Mechanistically, we provide evidence that necrosome-like RIPK1
               and RIPK3 aggregates facilitate canonical TRIF-dependent
               IFN-$\beta$ production downstream of the LPS receptor TLR4.
               Intriguingly, we also show that RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase-dependent
               synthesis of IFN-$\beta$ is markedly induced by avirulent

  abstract  = "The importance of transcriptional regulation of host genes in
               innate immunity against viral infection has been widely
               recognized. More recently, post-transcriptional regulatory
               mechanisms have gained appreciation as an additional and
               important layer of regulation to fine-tune host immune
               responses. Here, we review the functional significance of
               alternative splicing in innate immune responses to viral
               infection. We describe how several central components of the
               Type I and III interferon pathways encode spliced isoforms to
               regulate IFN activation and function. Additionally, the
               functional roles of splicing factors and modulators in antiviral
               immunity are discussed. Lastly, we discuss how cell death
               pathways are regulated by alternative splicing as well as the
               potential role of this regulation on host immunity and viral
               infection. Altogether, these studies highlight the importance of
               RNA splicing in regulating host-virus interactions and suggest a
               role in downregulating antiviral innate immunity; this may be

               known as CARDIF, IPS-1, KIAA1271 and VISA, is a mitochondria
               associated protein that regulates type I interferon production
               through coordinated activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3. The
               N-terminal CARD domain of MAVS interacts with RIGI helicase of
               upcapped RNA detection and the putative TRAF2 and TRAF6 binding
               motifs modulate protein interaction for NF-kappaB activation.
               MAVS is encoded by a single gene composed of 6 exons but is
               generally detected as multiple protein bands after separation by
               SDS-PAGE. In an effort to identify MAVS variants with diverse
               biological functions, we isolated three splicing variants and
               named them MAVS 1a (exon 2 deletion), 1b (exon 3 deletion) and
               1c (exon 6 deletion), respectively. MAVS 1a and 1b, due to a
               frame shift by exon deletion, encode 131 and 124 aa residues,
               respectively. Except the first 39 aa residues encoded by exon 1,
               MAVS 1a does not share sequence homology with known proteins, it
               instead contains a putative TRAF2-binding motif and interacts
               with TRAF2 and RIP1. MAVS 1b shares the first 97 residues with
               wt MAVS and 27 aa residues of unknown protein. Unlike MAVS that
               activates both NF-kappaB and IRF3 pathways, expression of MAVS
               1b selectively activates an IFNbeta but not an IL8 promoter.
               MAVS 1b interacts with RIP1 and FADD and exhibits anti-viral

               understudied. Given their crucial role in regulating pre-mRNA

               members of the SR/hnRNP protein families regulate innate immune

               expression and alternatively spliced isoform production in ten
               SR/hnRNP knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell lines
               following infection with the bacterial pathogen Salmonella
               enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella). We identified
               thousands of transcripts whose abundance is increased or
               decreased by SR/hnRNP knockdown in macrophages. Notably, we
               observed that SR and hnRNP proteins influence expression of
               different genes in uninfected versus Salmonella-infected
               macrophages, suggesting functionalization of these proteins upon
               pathogen sensing. Likewise, we found that knockdown of SR/hnRNPs
               promoted differential isoform usage (DIU) for thousands of
               macrophage transcripts and that these alternative splicing
               changes were distinct in uninfected and Salmonella-infected
               macrophages. Finally, having observed a surprising degree of
               similarity between the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and
               DIUs in hnRNP K and U knockdown macrophages, we found that hnRNP
               K and U knockdown macrophages are both more restrictive to
               Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), while hnRNP K knockdown
               macrophages are more permissive to Salmonella Typhimurium. Based
               on these findings, we conclude that many innate immune genes
               evolved to rely on one or more SR/hnRNPs to ensure the proper
               magnitude of their induction, supporting a model wherein
               pre-mRNA splicing is critical for regulating innate immune gene

               HLA-DRB1 gene variants, influence the susceptibility to RA. The
               HLA-DRB1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human
               leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. In this study, we compared the

               low-resolution genotyping of the HLA-DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5
               gene loci was performed by the sequence-specific polymerase
               chain reaction method (PCR-SSP). ESR and CRP were the most
               sensitive acute-phase reactants in females with RA and there was
               a correlation between ESR and CRP values in RA patients. There
               was significantly positive association between of the
               HLA-DRB1*03, *04, *08, *10, *11, and *14 variants and elevated
               values of ESR in RA patients, but negative between HLA-DRB1*03,
               *13 and *15 alleles and elevated CRP values. Furthermore, our
               results confirm genetic susceptibility to RA in a female
               population to the members of the HLA-DRB1*04 and *03 allelic
               groups, the DRB1*04/DRB1*04 and DRB1*03/DRB1*04 genotypes, and
               the DRB1*04-DRB4* or DRB1*03-DRB3* haplotypes, which, therefore,
               represent risk factors for the development of this disease.
               According to our results, the DRB1*01/DRB1*15 and
               DRB1*07/DRB1*16 genotypes and the HLA-DRB5 gene locus represent
               a protective factor for RA. The presence of specific HLA-DRB1
               gene variants increases the risk of developing RA, while other
               variants provide protection against disease. Therefore, HLA
               typing could be helpful in the prediction of RA development and
               establishing and confirming a definitive diagnosis of autoimmune
               diseases in some subjects. A strong association with the higher
               levels of ESR and CRP could be used to establish definitive

               alternative complement factor B (hBf) in human sepsis, we
               examined the induction of Bf gene expression in human peripheral
               blood monocytes (PBMCs) from patients with septic shock and the
               mechanisms of hBf gene regulation by tumor necrosis factor
               (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and lipopolysaccharide
               (LPS) in human monocytes. PBMCs from septic shock patients
               showed increased hBf mRNA expression when compared with control
               patients. Costimulation with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma or
               stimulation with LPS demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent
               induction of hBf mRNA expression in human PBMCs. A region of the
               hBf promoter between -735 and +128 bp was found to mediate
               IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and LPS responsiveness as well as the
               synergistic effect of IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha on hBf promoter
               activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of a IFN-gamma-activation
               site (GAS) cis element (-90 to -82 bp) abrogated IFN-gamma
               responsiveness. Mutagenesis of a nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB cis
               element at -466 to -456 bp abrogated TNF-alpha and LPS
               responsiveness of the Bf promoter. Thus hBf gene expression is
               induced in PBMCs from septic shock patients, and the induction
               of hBf by IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and LPS is through GAS and
               NF-kappaB cis-binding sites on the hBf promoter. Furthermore,
               activated protein C (APC) inhibited LPS-stimulated hBf promoter
               activity and protein expression in human monocytes suggesting
               that the beneficial effect of APC therapy in sepsis may in part
               be due to inhibition of complement induction and/or activation
               via the alternative pathway.",

               the alternative complement pathway. The inflammatory cytokines,
               in particular TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, are critical in the
               regulation of Bf gene expression in macrophages. In this study,
               we investigated the mechanisms of Bf gene regulation by
               TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in murine macrophages. Northern analysis
               revealed that Bf mRNA expression was synergistically
               up-regulated by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in MH-S cells.
               Truncations of the 5' Bf promoter identified a region between
               -556 and -282 bp that mediated TNF-alpha responsiveness as well
               as the synergistic effect of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma on Bf
               expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of a NF-kappaB-binding
               element in this region (-433 to -423 bp) abrogated TNF-alpha
               responsiveness and decreased the synergistic effect of TNF-alpha
               and IFN-gamma on Bf expression. EMSAs revealed nuclear protein
               binding to this NF-kappaB cis-binding element on TNF-alpha
               stimulation. Supershift analysis revealed that both p50 and p65
               proteins contribute to induction of Bf by TNF-alpha. An I-kappaB
               dominant negative mutant blocked Bf induction by TNF-alpha and
               reduced the synergistic induction by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. In
               addition, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which blocks NF-kappaB
               induction, blocked TNF-alpha-induced Bf promoter activity and
               the synergistic induction of Bf promoter activity by TNF-alpha
               and IFN-gamma. LPS was found to induce Bf promoter activity
               through the same NF-kappaB cis-binding site. These findings
               suggest that a NF-kappaB cis-binding site between -433 and -423
               bp is required for TNF-alpha responsiveness and for TNF-alpha-

  abstract  = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped
               thousands of loci associated with complex traits. These
               associations could reveal the molecular mechanisms altered in
               common complex diseases and result in the identification of
               novel drug targets. However, GWAS have also left a number of
               outstanding questions. In particular, the majority of
               disease-associated loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome
               and, even though they are thought to play a role in gene
               expression regulation, it is unclear which genes they regulate
               and in which cell types or physiological contexts this
               regulation occurs. This has hindered the translation of GWAS
               findings into clinical interventions. In this review we
               summarize how these challenges have been addressed over the last
               decade, with a particular focus on the integration of GWAS
               results with functional genomics datasets. Firstly, we

               can be identified using methods that test for enrichment of GWAS
               variants in genomic annotations. Secondly, we explore how to
               find the genes regulated by GWAS loci using methods that test
               for colocalization of GWAS signals with molecular phenotypes
               such as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Finally, we highlight
               potential future research avenues such as integrating GWAS
               results with single-cell sequencing read-outs, designing
               functionally informed polygenic risk scores (PRS), and
               validating disease associated genes using genetic engineering.
               These tools will be crucial to identify new drug targets for

               intravenous dosing regimens in patients with fistulizing CD.
               METHODS: Patients with moderately to severely active CD and 1-3
               active perianal fistulae (identified on magnetic resonance
               imaging [MRI]) received vedolizumab 300 mg intravenously at

               assessment, 28 (14 per dosing regimen) had $\geq$1 draining
               fistulae at baseline (assessed by gentle finger compression

               $\geq$50\% decrease in draining fistulae and 100\% fistulae

               bowel disease fistulae has been performed. In addition, Crohn's
               disease fistulae have not been well characterised
               morphologically. METHODS: Eighty four fistulae from Crohn's
               disease patients were compared with 13 fistulae from controls.
               Haematoxylin-eosin staining, electron microscopy, and
               immunohistochemistry for panCytokeratin (epithelial cells), CD20
               (B cells), CD45R0 (T cells), and CD68 (macrophages) were
               performed according to standard techniques. In addition,
               histopathological findings were compared with clinical and
               laboratory data. RESULTS: In 31.0\% of controls and 27.4\% of
               Crohn's disease specimens, fistulae had a lining of flattened
               intestinal epithelium without goblet cells or, in the case of
               cutaneous/perianal disease, narrow squamous epithelium.
               Non-epithelialised fistulae were covered by a thin layer of
               (myo)fibroblasts, focally forming a new basement membrane, as
               demonstrated by electron microscopy. All fistulae were
               surrounded by granulation tissue. Crohn's disease fistulae
               presented with central infiltration by CD45R0+ T cells, followed
               by a small band of CD68+ macrophages and dense accumulation of
               CD20+ B cells. In contrast, in controls, there was dense
               infiltration by CD68+ macrophages with only few CD20+ B cells
               and CD45R0+ T lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulae in Crohn's
               disease differ markedly from non-Crohn's disease fistulae with
               regard to their cellular composition. The presence of an
               epithelial lining in a subgroup of fistulae may be important for
               the therapeutic approach and healing process.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumor
               necrosis factor, is an effective maintenance therapy for
               patients with Crohn's disease without fistulas. It is not known
               whether infliximab is an effective maintenance therapy for
               patients with fistulas. METHODS: We performed a multicenter,
               double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate
               the efficacy of infliximab maintenance therapy in 306 adult
               patients with Crohn's disease and one or more draining abdominal
               or perianal fistulas of at least three months' duration.
               Patients received 5 mg of infliximab per kilogram of body weight
               intravenously on weeks 0, 2, and 6. A total of 195 patients who
               had a response at weeks 10 and 14 and 87 patients who had no
               response were then randomly assigned to receive placebo or 5 mg
               of infliximab per kilogram every eight weeks and to be followed
               to week 54. The primary analysis was the time to the loss of
               response among patients who had a response at week 14 and
               underwent randomization. RESULTS: The time to loss of response
               was significantly longer for patients who received infliximab
               maintenance therapy than for those who received placebo
               maintenance (more than 40 weeks vs. 14 weeks, P<0.001). At week
               54, 19 percent of patients in the placebo maintenance group had
               a complete absence of draining fistulas, as compared with 36
               percent of patients in the infliximab maintenance group
               (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with fistulizing Crohn's
               disease who have a response to induction therapy with infliximab
               have an increased likelihood of a sustained response over a
               54-week period if infliximab treatment is continued every 8
               weeks.",

               risk of various diseases, especially autoimmune diseases.
               Fine-mapping of causal variants in this region was challenging
               due to the difficulty in sequencing and its inapplicability to
               large cohorts. Thus, HLA imputation, a method to infer HLA types
               from regional single nucleotide polymorphisms, has been
               developed and has successfully contributed to MHC fine-mapping
               of various diseases. Different HLA imputation methods have been
               developed, each with its own advantages, and recent methods have
               been improved in terms of accuracy and computational
               performance. Additionally, advances in HLA reference panels by
               next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled higher
               resolution and a more reliable imputation, allowing a

               mechanisms including alterations in peripheral responses and
               central thymic selection of T cells. The cooperation of reliable
               HLA imputation methods, informative fine-mapping, and
               experimental validation of the functional significance of MHC

               an essential tool in the analysis of diseases and adverse drug
               reactions with associations mapping to the major
               histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, deriving
               high-resolution HLA types subsequent to whole-genome
               single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing or sequencing is
               often cost prohibitive for large samples. An alternative
               approach takes advantage of the extended haplotype structure
               within the MHC to predict HLA alleles using dense SNP genotypes,
               such as those available from genome-wide SNP panels. Current
               methods for HLA imputation are difficult to apply or may require
               the user to have access to large training data sets with SNP and
               HLA types. We propose HIBAG, HLA Imputation using attribute
               BAGging, that makes predictions by averaging HLA-type posterior
               probabilities over an ensemble of classifiers built on bootstrap
               samples. We assess the performance of HIBAG using our study data
               (n=2668 subjects of European ancestry) as a training set and HLA
               data from the British 1958 birth cohort study (n$\approx$1000
               subjects) as independent validation samples. Prediction
               accuracies for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 range from 92.2\% to
               98.1\% using a set of SNP markers common to the Illumina 1M Duo,
               OmniQuad, OmniExpress, 660K and 550K platforms. HIBAG performed
               well compared with the other two leading methods, HLA*IMP and
               BEAGLE. This method is implemented in a freely available HIBAG R
               package that includes pre-fit classifiers for European, Asian,
               Hispanic and African ancestries, providing a readily available

               chromosome 6p21.3, play an important role in many autoimmune
               disorders, such as celiac disease (CD), type 1 diabetes (T1D),
               rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and others.
               Known HLA variants that confer risk to CD, for example, include
               DQA1*05/DQB1*02 (DQ2.5) and DQA1*03/DQB1*0302 (DQ8). To diagnose
               the majority of CD patients and to study disease susceptibility
               and progression, typing these strongly associated HLA risk
               factors is of utmost importance. However, current genotyping
               methods for HLA risk factors involve many reactions, and are
               complicated and expensive. We sought a simple experimental
               approach using tagging SNPs that predict the CD-associated HLA
               risk factors. METHODOLOGY: Our tagging approach exploits linkage
               disequilibrium between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and
               the CD-associated HLA risk factors DQ2.5 and DQ8 that indicate
               direct risk, and DQA1*0201/DQB1*0202 (DQ2.2) and
               DQA1*0505/DQB1*0301 (DQ7) that attribute to the risk of DQ2.5 to
               CD. To evaluate the predictive power of this approach, we
               performed an empirical comparison of the predicted DQ types,
               based on these six tag SNPs, with those executed with current
               validated laboratory typing methods of the HLA-DQA1 and -DQB1
               genes in three large cohorts. The results were validated in
               three European celiac populations. CONCLUSION: Using this
               method, only six SNPs were needed to predict the risk types
               carried by >95\% of CD patients. We determined that for this
               tagging approach the sensitivity was >0.991, specificity >0.996
               and the predictive value >0.948. Our results show that this tag
               SNP method is very accurate and provides an excellent basis for
               population screening for CD. This method is broadly applicable
               in European populations.",

               test whether these variants are associated with inflammatory
               bowel disease (IBD) in adult- and childhood-onset Italian
               patients. METHODS: Allele and genotype frequencies of rs1000113
               and rs4958847 were determined in 823 CD (265 younger than 19
               years at diagnosis), 353 ulcerative colitis (UC) (130 younger

               sub-phenotypes and CARD15 genotypes. RESULTS: rs1000113 and
               rs4958847 were both associated with adult-onset (P=2 x 10(-4);
               P=2.5 x 10(-3), respectively) and childhood-onset (P=4 x 10(-4);
               P=8 x 10(-3), respectively) CD cohorts. Similarly, the genotype
               frequencies remained significantly different for both variants

               pediatric rs1000113, P=2.3 x 10(-4); rs4958847, P=9.6 x 10(-3)).
               At logistic regression, the rs4958847 polymorphism was
               associated with fistulizing behavior (P=0.037, OR=1.54,

               one-quarter of CD patients and represents a distinct disease
               phenotype. The objective of this study was to investigate a
               large population-based cohort of inflammatory bowel disease
               (IBD) patients to identify clinical and genetic risk factors for
               perianal CD. METHODS: Data were collected in the Canterbury IBD
               database, estimated to include 91\% of all patients with IBD in
               Canterbury, New Zealand. Genotyping was performed for selected
               loci previously demonstrated to be associated with CD. Patients
               with perianal disease were then compared with both CD patients
               without perianal disease and healthy controls to assess the
               presence of potential phenotypic, environmental, and genetic
               risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 715 CD patients in the database,
               190 (26.5\%) had perianal disease. In all, 507 patients with
               genotype data available were analyzed. Perianal disease was
               associated with younger age at diagnosis (P < 0.0001),
               complicated intestinal disease (P < 0.0001), and ileal disease
               location (P = 0.002). There was no association with gender,
               ethnicity, smoking, or breast feeding. Genotype analysis
               revealed an association with the neutrophil cytosolic factor 4
               (NCF4) gene compared with both non-perianal CD patients (odds
               ratio (OR): 1.47; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.99) and
               healthy controls (OR: 1.47; 95\% CI: 1.10-1.95). There was no
               association identified with other genes, including IBD5 (OR:
               0.91; 95\% CI: 0.69-1.20), tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (OR:
               1.04; 95\% CI: 0.56-1.85), and IRGM (immunity-related guanosine
               triphosphatase protein type M) (OR: 1.21; 95\% CI: 0.80-1.82).
               CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that younger age at diagnosis,
               complicated disease behavior, and ileal disease location are
               risk factors for perianal CD. In addition, this paper represents
               the first report of an association of the NCF4 gene with
               perianal disease.",

               disease (PCD) remains poorly described and is mainly based on
               retrospective studies from referral centers. The aim of this
               study was to assess the incidence, outcomes and predictors of
               the onset of PCD. METHODS: All incident cases of patients
               diagnosed with possible CD were prospectively registered from
               1994 to 1997 in Brittany, a limited area in France. At
               diagnosis, the clinical features of perianal disease were
               recorded. All patient charts were reviewed from the diagnosis to
               the last clinic visit in 2015. RESULTS: Among the 272 out of 331
               incident CD patients followed up, 51 (18.7\%) patients had PCD
               at diagnosis. After a mean follow-up of 12.8 years, 93 (34\%)
               patients developed PCD. The cumulative probabilities of perianal
               CD occurrence were 22\%, 29\%, and 32\% after 1 year, 5 years,
               and 10 years, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of anal
               ulceration were 14\%, and 19\% after 1 year and 10 years,
               respectively. Extraintestinal manifestations were associated
               with the occurrence of anal ulceration. The cumulative
               probabilities of fistulizing PCD were 11\%, 16\%, and 19\% after
               1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. Extraintestinal
               manifestations, rectal involvement and anal ulceration were
               predictors of fistulizing PCD. The cumulative probability of
               developing anal stricture was 4\% after 10 years. CONCLUSIONS:
               PCD is frequently observed during CD, in approximately one-third
               of patients. These data underline the need for targeted
               therapeutic research on primary perianal lesions (proctitis,
               anal ulceration) to avoid the onset of fistulizing perianal
               disease.",

               (SNPs) presents a challenge in genome-wide association studies,
               when hundreds of thousands of association tests are conducted.
               The power to detect genetic effects is dependent on minor allele
               frequency (MAF), and genome-wide association studies SNP arrays
               include SNPs with a wide distribution of MAFs. Therefore, it is
               critical to understand MAF's effect on the false positive
               rate.Data from the Framingham Heart Study simulated data
               (Problem 3, with answers) was used to examine the effects of
               varying MAFs on the likelihood of false positives. Replication
               set 1 was used to generate 1 million permutations of
               case/control status in unrelated individuals. Logistic
               regression was used to test for the association between each SNP
               and myocardial infarction using an additive model. We report the
               number of ``significant'' tests by MAF at alpha = 10-4, 10-5,
               and 10-6.Common SNPs exhibited fewer false positives than
               expected. At alpha = 10-4, SNPs with MAF 25\% and 50\% resulted
               in 69.2 [95\%CI: 62.8-75.6] and 70.8 [95\%CI: 61.3-80.4] false
               positives, respectively, compared to 100 expected. Rare SNPs
               exhibited more variability but did not show more false-positive
               results than expected by chance. However, at alpha = 10-4, MAF =
               5\% exhibited significantly more false positives (105.5 [95\%CI:
               81-130.1]) than MAF = 25\% and 50\%. Similar results were seen
               at the other alpha values.These results suggest that removal of
               low MAF SNPs from analysis due to concerns about inflated
               false-positive results may not be appropriate.",

               macrophage polarization in vitro greatly contributes to our
               understanding of macrophage biology. Macrophages are divided
               into two main groups: Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages
               (classically activated) and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages
               (alternatively activated), based on several key surface markers
               and the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the
               expression of these common macrophage polarization markers is
               greatly affected by the stimulation time used. Unfortunately,
               there is no consensus yet regarding the optimal stimulation
               times for particular macrophage polarization markers in in vitro
               experiments. This situation is problematic, (i) as analysing a
               particular marker at a suboptimal time point can lead to
               false-negative results, and (ii) as it clearly impedes the

               markers in vitro. Providing such a reference guide will likely
               facilitate the investigation of macrophage polarization and its

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Exposure of macrophages to bacterial products such
               as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in activation of the
               NF-kappaB transcription factor, which orchestrates a gene
               expression programme that underpins the macrophage-dependent
               immune response. These changes include the induction or
               repression of a wide range of genes that regulate inflammation,
               cell proliferation, migration and cell survival. This process is
               tightly regulated and loss of control is associated with
               conditions such as septic shock, inflammatory diseases and
               cancer. To study this response, it is important to have in vitro
               model systems that reflect the behaviour of cells in vivo. In
               addition, it is necessary to understand the natural differences
               that can occur between individuals. In this report, we have
               investigated and compared the LPS response in macrophage derived
               cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) derived
               macrophages. RESULTS: Gene expression profiles were determined
               following LPS treatment of THP-1 cells for 1 and 4 hours. LPS
               significantly induced or repressed 72 out of 465 genes selected
               as being known or putative NF-kappaB target genes, which
               exhibited 4 temporal patterns of expression. Results for 34 of
               these genes, including several genes not previously identified
               as LPS target genes, were validated using real time PCR. A high
               correlation between microarray and real time PCR data was found.
               Significantly, the LPS induced expression profile of THP-1
               cells, as determined using real time PCR, was found to be very
               similar to that of human PBMC derived macrophages.
               Interestingly, some differences were observed in the LPS
               response between the two donor PBMC macrophage populations.
               Surprisingly, we found that the LPS response in U937 cells was
               dramatically different to both THP-1 and PBMC derived
               macrophages. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a dynamic and
               diverse transcriptional response to LPS in macrophages,
               involving both the induction and repression of gene expression
               in a time dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrated that the
               LPS induced transcriptional response in the THP-1 cell line is
               very similar to primary PBMC derived macrophages. Therefore,
               THP-1 cells represent a good model system for studying the
               mechanisms of LPS and NF-kappaB dependent gene expression.",

               Downstream analysis of this catalog provides insight into the
               mechanisms underlying splicing regulation. We report that a core
               set of sQTLs is shared across multiple tissues. sQTLs often
               target the global splicing pattern of genes, rather than
               individual splicing events. Many also affect the expression of
               the same or other genes, uncovering regulatory loci that act
               through different mechanisms. sQTLs tend to be located in
               post-transcriptionally spliced introns, which would function as
               hotspots for splicing regulation. While many variants affect
               splicing patterns by altering the sequence of splice sites, many
               more modify the binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Genetic
               variants affecting splicing can have a stronger phenotypic

               connective tissue disorder characterized by hyperextensible
               skin, joint hypermobility and soft tissue fragility. The classic
               subtype of EDS is caused by mutations in one of the type V
               collagen genes (COL5A1 and COL5A2). Most mutations affect the
               type V collagen helical domain and lead to a diminished or
               structurally abnormal type V collagen protein. Remarkably, only
               two mutations were reported to affect the extended, highly
               conserved N-propeptide domain, which plays an important role in
               the regulation of the heterotypic collagen fibril diameter. We
               identified a novel COL5A1 N-propeptide mutation, resulting in an
               unusual but severe classic EDS phenotype and a remarkable
               splicing outcome. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified
               a novel COL5A1 N-propeptide acceptor-splice site mutation
               (IVS6-2A>G, NM\_000093.3\_c.925-2A>G) in a patient with
               cutaneous features of EDS, severe progressive scoliosis and eye
               involvement. Two mutant transcripts were identified, one with an
               exon 7 skip and one in which exon 7 and the upstream exon 6 are
               deleted. Both transcripts are expressed and secreted into the
               extracellular matrix, where they can participate in and perturb
               collagen fibrillogenesis, as illustrated by the presence of
               dermal collagen cauliflowers. Determination of the order of
               intron removal and computational analysis showed that
               simultaneous skipping of exons 6 and 7 is due to the combined
               effect of delayed splicing of intron 7, altered pre-mRNA
               secondary structure, low splice site strength and possibly
               disturbed binding of splicing factors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
               We report a novel COL5A1 N-propeptide acceptor-splice site
               mutation in intron 6, which not only affects splicing of the
               adjacent exon 7, but also causes a splicing error of the
               upstream exon 6. Our findings add further insights into the
               COL5A1 splicing order and show for the first time that a single
               COL5A1 acceptor-splice site mutation can perturb splicing of the
               upstream exon.",

               of pseudoexons containing premature stop codons c.1679+1634A>G
               (1811+1.6kbA>G) and c.3718-2477C>T (3849+10kbC>T), or an

               (3272-26A>G). We designed pairs of Cas9 guide RNAs to create
               targeted double-stranded breaks in CFTR either side of each
               mutation which resulted in high efficiency excision of the
               target genomic regions via non-homologous end-joining repair.
               When evaluated in a mini-gene splicing assay, we showed that
               targeted excision restored normal splicing for all three
               mutations. This approach could be used to correct aberrant
               splicing signals or remove disruptive transcription regulatory
               motifs caused by deep-intronic mutations in a range of other

               This increase in disease severity is due in part to

               In accordance, human PTPs have been linked to intestinal

               mediate host defense, and alternatively activated,
               tolerance-inducing (M2) macrophages that exert homeostatic and
               tissue-regenerative functions. Disturbed macrophage
               function/differentiation results either in inadequate, excessive
               immune activation or in a failure to induce efficient protective
               immune responses against pathogens. Loss-of-function variants in

               Here we report that PTPN2-deficient macrophages fail to acquire

               the spatiotemporal regulation of signal transmission in cells.
               Accordingly, endocytosis and membrane trafficking regulate
               virtually every aspect of cell physiology and are frequently

               context-dependency and long-range effects. First,
               endocytic-regulated outputs are not stereotyped but heavily

               Second, endocytic regulation has an impact not only on
               individual cells but also on the behaviour of cellular

  abstract = "Inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson's disease are chronic
              progressive disorders that mainly affect different organs: the
              gut and brain, respectively. Accumulating evidence has suggested
              a bidirectional link between gastrointestinal inflammation and
              neurodegeneration, in accordance with the concept of the
              'gut-brain axis'. Moreover, recent population-based studies have
              shown that inflammatory bowel disease might increase the risk of
              Parkinson's disease. Although the precise mechanisms underlying
              gut-brain interactions remain elusive, some of the latest
              findings have begun to explain the link. Several genetic loci are
              shared between both disorders with a similar direction of effect
              on the risk of both diseases. The most interesting example is
              LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), initially identified as a
              causal gene in Parkinson's disease, and recently also implicated
              in Crohn's disease. In this review, we highlight recent findings
              on the link between these seemingly unrelated diseases with
              shared genetic susceptibility. We discuss supporting and
              conflicting data obtained from epidemiological and genetic
              studies along with remaining questions and concerns. In addition,
              we discuss possible biological links including the gut-brain
              axis, microbiota, autoimmunity, mitochondrial function and
              autophagy.",

               establishment and maintenance of this asymmetric structure
               depend on polarized trafficking of specific cargos, but the
               precise molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. We
               previously showed that Rab35, a member of the Rab family small
               GTPases, differentially regulates the trafficking of an apical
               cargo, podocalyxin (PODXL), in two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cell

               effectors, OCRL inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (OCRL) and
               ArfGAP with coiled-coil, ankyrin repeat and pleckstrin homology
               domains 2 (ACAP2), respectively. However, whether the upstream
               regulators of Rab35 also differ depending on the culture
               conditions remains completely unknown. Here, we investigated
               four known guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of Rab35,
               namely DENN domain-containing 1A (DENND1A), DENND1B, DENND1C,
               and folliculin (FLCN), and demonstrate that DENND1A and FLCN
               exhibit distinct requirements for Rab35-dependent PODXL
               trafficking under the two culture conditions. In 3D cell
               cultures, only DENDN1A-knockout cysts exhibited the inverted
               localization of PODXL similar to that of Rab35-knockout cysts.
               Moreover, the DENN domain, harboring GEF activity toward Rab35,
               was required for proper PODXL trafficking to the apical
               membrane. By contrast, FLCN-knockdown cells specifically
               accumulated PODXL in actin-rich structures similar to the
               Rab35-knockdown cells in 2D cell cultures. Our findings indicate
               that two distinct functional cascades of Rab35, the
               FLCN-Rab35-OCRL and the DENND1A-Rab35-ACAP2 axes, regulate PODXL

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The vast majority of trait-associated variants
               identified using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are
               noncoding, and therefore assumed to impact gene regulation.
               However, the majority of trait-associated loci are unexplained
               by regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTLs). RESULTS: We
               perform a comprehensive characterization of the putative
               mechanisms by which GWAS loci impact human immune traits. By
               harmonizing four major immune QTL studies, we identify 26,271
               expression QTLs (eQTLs) and 23,121 splicing QTLs (sQTLs)
               spanning 18 immune cell types. Our colocalization analyses
               between QTLs and trait-associated loci from 72 GWAS reveals that
               genetic effects on RNA expression and splicing in immune cells
               colocalize with 40.4\% of GWAS loci for immune-related traits,
               in many cases increasing the fraction of colocalized loci by two
               fold compared to previous studies. Notably, we find that the
               largest contributors of this increase are splicing QTLs, which
               colocalize on average with 14\% of all GWAS loci that do not
               colocalize with eQTLs. By contrast, we find that cell
               type-specific eQTLs, and eQTLs with small effect sizes
               contribute very few new colocalizations. To investigate the 60\%
               of GWAS loci that remain unexplained, we collect H3K27ac
               CUT\&Tag data from rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls,
               and find large-scale differences between immune cells from the
               different disease contexts, including at regions overlapping
               unexplained GWAS loci. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our work supports
               RNA splicing as an important mediator of genetic effects on
               immune traits, and suggests that we must expand our study of
               regulatory processes in disease contexts to improve functional
               interpretation of as yet unexplained GWAS loci.",

  author    = "Melamud, Eugene and Moult, John",
  abstract  = "Even though nearly every human gene has at least one alternative
               splice form, very little is so far known about the structure and
               function of resulting protein products. It is becoming
               increasingly clear that a significant fraction of all isoforms
               are products of noisy selection of splice sites and thus
               contribute little to actual functional diversity, and may
               potentially be deleterious. In this study, we examine the impact
               of alternative splicing on protein sequence and structure in
               three datasets: alternative splicing events conserved across
               multiple species, alternative splicing events in genes that are
               strongly linked to disease and all observed alternative splicing
               events. We find that the vast majority of all alternative
               isoforms result in unstable protein conformations. In contrast
               to that, the small subset of isoforms conserved across species
               tends to maintain protein structural integrity to a greater
               extent. Alternative splicing in disease-associated genes
               produces unstable structures just as frequently as all other
               genes, indicating that selection to reduce the effects of
               alternative splicing on this set is not especially pronounced.
               Overall, the properties of alternative spliced proteins are
               consistent with the outcome of noisy selection of splice sites

              Short-read RNA sequencing approaches fail to resolve RNA isoforms

              isoform unaware representation of the transcriptome. Conversely,

              to capture complete transcript isoforms, but their utility is
              deeply constrained due to throughput limitations. Here, we
              introduce MAS-ISO-seq, a technique for programmably concatenating
              cDNAs into single molecules optimal for long-read sequencing,
              boosting the throughput >15 fold to nearly 40 million cDNA reads

              of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Results demonstrated a >30 fold

               lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
               technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
               high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
               limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
               billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
               the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
               based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
               that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in
               uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and
               stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor
               of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550
               million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
               12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment
               sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo
               detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover
               non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is
               also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche
               454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain
               reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel
               intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate,
               corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

              transcriptomic data. While many events are corroborated by the
              aforementioned tools, the flexibility of RegTools also allows us
              to identify splice-associated variants in known cancer drivers,
              such as TP53, CDKN2A, and B2M, and other genes.",

               of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become
               commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of
               features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null
               hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be

               statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on
               the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a
               sensible balance between the number of true and false positives
               that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In
               doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q
               value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is
               similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of
               significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than
               the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false
               positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than
               what has been used in genome scans for linkage.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) seems to
               play an important role in the pathogenesis of fistulae, a common
               clinical complication of Crohn's disease (CD). TGF$\beta$ and
               interleukin-13 (IL-13) have been correlated with the onset of
               EMT-associated organ fibrosis and high levels of TGF$\beta$ have
               been shown in transitional cells (TCs) lining CD fistula tracts.
               This study investigated whether IL-13 could be involved in the
               pathogenesis of CD-associated fistulae. DESIGN: Protein or mRNA
               levels in HT29 intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or colonic
               lamina propria fibroblasts (CLPFs) were studied by western
               blotting or real-time PCR. CLPFs were isolated from
               non-inflammatory disease controls or patients with CD with or
               without fistulae and IL-13 levels were analysed in surgically
               removed fistula specimens by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:
               TGF$\beta$ induced IL-13 secretion in CLPFs from patients with
               fistulising CD. In fistula specimens high levels of IL-13 were
               detected in TCs covering fistula tracts. In HT29 IEC monolayers,
               IL-13 induced SLUG and $\beta$6-integrin mRNA, which are
               associated with cell invasion. HT29 spheroids completely
               disintegrated when treated with TGF$\beta$ for 7 days, whereas
               IL-13-treated spheroids did not show morphological changes.
               Here, TGF$\beta$ induced mRNA expression of SNAIL1 and IL-13,
               whereas IL-13 elevated SLUG and $\beta$6-integrin mRNA. An
               anti-IL-13 antibody was able to prevent IL-13-induced SLUG
               expression in HT29 IECs. CONCLUSIONS: TGF$\beta$ induces IL-13
               expression and an EMT-like phenotype of IECs, while IL-13
               promotes the expression of genes associated with cell invasion.
               These findings suggest that TGF$\beta$ and IL-13 play a
               synergistic role in the pathogenesis of fistulae and inhibition
               of IL-13 might represent a novel therapeutic approach for
               fistula treatment.",

               clinical trials that are designed to test drugs for the end
               point of disease modification in chronic disabling diseases.
               Natural history studies can also help to identify subsets of
               patients in whom the disease prognosis can be stratified
               according to clinical features. This comprehensive review
               summarizes our current knowledge of the natural history of
               Crohn's disease in adults as reported in population-based
               studies that include long-term follow-up results. METHODS: We
               conducted a literature search of English and non-English
               language publications listed in the electronic databases of
               MEDLINE (source PUBMED, 1935 to December 2008). RESULTS:
               One-third of the patients had ileitis, colitis, or ileocolitis
               at the time of diagnosis. Disease location remained broadly
               stable over time. Up to one-third of the patients had evidence
               of a stricturing or penetrating intestinal complication at
               diagnosis, and half of all patients had experienced an
               intestinal complication within 20 years after diagnosis. Ten
               percent of the patients had prolonged clinical remission.
               Steroid dependency occurred in one-third of the patients, and
               surgery was required in one-third after initiation of steroid
               therapy. The annual incidence of hospitalizations was 20\%. Half
               of the patients required surgery within 10 years after
               diagnosis. The risk of postoperative recurrence was 44-55\%
               after 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease is a disabling
               condition over time. The impact of changing treatment paradigms

               in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). At least one third of CD
               patients suffer from fistulas during their disease course and
               amongst them longstanding remission of complex fistulas occurs
               only in about one third. So far, fistula pathogenesis is only
               partially understood. From a histopathological view, a fistula
               is a tube covered by flat epithelial cells. Current research
               suggests that the driving force for fistula development is
               epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Around the fistula,
               high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-13, and
               TGF$\beta$ can be detected and recent studies indicated an
               involvement of the intestinal microbiota. Fistula diagnosis
               requires clinical and surgical assessment, radiologic
               investigations, e.g., magnet resonance imaging and endoscopy.
               Routine medical treatment of fistulas includes antibiotics,
               immunosuppressives, and anti-TNF antibodies. There is no
               well-established role for calcineurin inhibitors in fistula

               tissue-derived or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells

               medical treatment and recurrence of fistulas, surgical

               distinct from luminal Crohn's disease and may follow a different
               course. To date, the only detailed classifications of perianal
               Crohn's disease arise from referral center cohorts that do not
               reflect the spectrum of disease in the population as a whole.
               OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to document the rate,
               classification, and time course of symptomatic perianal Crohn's
               disease in a population-based cohort. DESIGN: This is a
               population-based cohort study. SETTING: : This study was
               conducted in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. PATIENTS: All
               patients with IBD in Canterbury, New Zealand, were eligible for
               recruitment over a 3-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
               clinical records of all patients with Crohn's disease were
               reviewed, and all symptomatic perianal disease was classified
               according to the American Gastroenterological Society position
               statement. The rate of perianal involvement and timing of onset
               relative to Crohn's diagnosis was determined. RESULTS:
               Ninety-one percent of IBD patients in the region were recruited.
               Seven hundred fifteen patients had Crohn's disease, of which 190
               (26.6\%) patients had symptomatic perianal disease. The median
               age of patients with perianal disease was 37 years (range, 4-82
               years) and 58.4\% were female. Median follow-up was 9 years
               (range, 2 months to 45 years) from Crohn's disease diagnosis.
               Onset of perianal disease ranged from 18 years pre-Crohn's
               diagnosis to 33 years post-Crohn's diagnosis. Fistulas were the
               most common lesion (50\% of patients), followed by perianal
               abscesses (42.1\%), fissures (32.6\%), skin tags (11.1\%),
               strictures (7.4\%), and hemorrhoids (1.6\%). The cumulative
               probability at 20 years of any perianal Crohn's disease was
               42.7\% and of a perianal fistula 28.3\%. LIMITATIONS: This study
               assumed all noted perianal lesions were related to Crohn's

	Abstract = {Troublesome perianal disease occurs in approximately 35% of patients with Crohn's disease, yet conventional disease activity indices do not reflect the severity of this feature. To assess the degree of impairment and response to therapy, we identified five simple elements and graded each on a 5-point Likert scale in 37 patients at 124 visits. At each visit a Crohn's Disease (CDAI) or Simple Activity Index (HBDAI), Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and treatment were recorded. The PDAI was validated against physician (MDGA) and patient (PGA) global assessments, and treatment was prescribed for the perianal disease. Measurement error was evaluated in 19 patients who were clinically stable at two consecutive visits. The ability of the PDAI to detect important clinical change was tested in 20 subjects exhibiting a change on PGA at consecutive visits. There were strong correlations between PDAI, MDGA, and PGA scores at all visits (R = 0.66-0.72; p &lt; 0.001), whereas the CDAI and HBDAI correlated poorly with PDAI (R &lt; 0.23). Physicians prescribed more aggressive therapy for higher PDAI scores (r = 0.53). Mean PDAI scores between visits in clinically stable subjects were not significantly different [5.58 +/- 2.79 (initial); 5.42 +/- 2.55 (follow-up); p = 0.63]. PDAI significantly improved between visits when the perianal disease had improved (PDAI score difference 3.05 +/- 2.96; P = .0002). We conclude that the PDAI is simple and clinically useful for patient management. It should now be assessed in a clinical trial.},

              challenging and requires its own domain of therapy. Different
              types of perianal disease require a spectrum of treatment
              strategies. Treatment options range from conservative therapy,
              including immunosuppressives, biologics, or stem cell therapy, to
              surgical treatment with specific indications depending on the
              underlying lesion. This is part III of the series
              ``state-of-the-art surgery for Crohn's disease,'' focusing on the
              management of perianal disease. We discuss the definition and
              diagnosis of perianal Crohn's disease, the treatment of perianal
              lesions, and specific surgical indications and techniques.

              substantial role in the treatment of perianal Crohn's disease,
              and surgical therapy may fail. Realistic treatment goals and an

               distinct from luminal Crohn's disease and may follow a different
               course. To date, the only detailed classifications of perianal
               Crohn's disease arise from referral center cohorts that do not
               reflect the spectrum of disease in the population as a whole.
               OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to document the rate,
               classification, and time course of symptomatic perianal Crohn's
               disease in a population-based cohort. DESIGN: This is a
               population-based cohort study. SETTING: : This study was
               conducted in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. PATIENTS: All
               patients with IBD in Canterbury, New Zealand, were eligible for
               recruitment over a 3-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
               clinical records of all patients with Crohn's disease were
               reviewed, and all symptomatic perianal disease was classified
               according to the American Gastroenterological Society position
               statement. The rate of perianal involvement and timing of onset
               relative to Crohn's diagnosis was determined. RESULTS:
               Ninety-one percent of IBD patients in the region were recruited.
               Seven hundred fifteen patients had Crohn's disease, of which 190
               (26.6\%) patients had symptomatic perianal disease. The median
               age of patients with perianal disease was 37 years (range, 4-82
               years) and 58.4\% were female. Median follow-up was 9 years
               (range, 2 months to 45 years) from Crohn's disease diagnosis.
               Onset of perianal disease ranged from 18 years pre-Crohn's
               diagnosis to 33 years post-Crohn's diagnosis. Fistulas were the
               most common lesion (50\% of patients), followed by perianal
               abscesses (42.1\%), fissures (32.6\%), skin tags (11.1\%),
               strictures (7.4\%), and hemorrhoids (1.6\%). The cumulative
               probability at 20 years of any perianal Crohn's disease was
               42.7\% and of a perianal fistula 28.3\%. LIMITATIONS: This study
               assumed all noted perianal lesions were related to Crohn's
               disease and the retrospective classification may have been
               inaccurate in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the
               first detailed classification of perianal Crohn's disease in a
               population-based cohort.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Perianal fistulas are a challenging manifestation of
               Crohn's disease. Best medical and surgical therapy results in
               only about a third of patients remaining in remission at one
               year on maintenance treatment and sustained healing is often
               elusive. There is little published data on patient perspective
               of living with the condition or coping strategies in the face of
               non-curative/non-definitive treatment. We aimed to understand
               the experience of living with perianal fistula(s) and their
               impact on quality of life and routine functioning. METHODS: This
               exploratory qualitative study used purposive sampling to recruit
               participants with current / previous diagnosis of Crohn's anal
               fistulas, from national IBD / bowel disease charities. The
               ``standards for reporting qualitative research'' (SRQR)
               recommendations were followed. Unstructured individual
               face-to-face interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and
               analysed thematically. Early themes were reviewed by the study
               team including patient advocates, clinicians and qualitative
               researchers. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were conducted,
               achieving apparent data saturation. Three broad themes were
               uncovered: Burden of symptoms; Burden of treatment; and Impact
               on emotional, physical and social well-being. Each included
               several sub-themes, with considerable interplay between these.
               The impact of perianal fistula(s) on patients with CD is intense
               and wide reaching, negatively affecting intimate, close and
               social relationships. Fistulas cause losses in life and
               work-related opportunities, and treatments can be difficult to
               tolerate. CONCLUSION: Crohn's perianal fistulas exert a heavy
               negative physical and emotional impact on patients. These
               findings will inform development of a patient reported outcome
               measure to assess treatment effectiveness and quality of life
               for patients living with this challenging condition.",

               patients with complex perianal fistulas. METHODS: PubMed,
               Embase, and Cochrane were searched for relevant articles
               (published 2000-November 2016) and congress abstracts (published
               2011-November 2016). RESULTS: Of 535 records reviewed, 62
               relevant sources were identified (mostly small observational
               studies). The cumulative incidence of complex perianal fistulas
               in CD from two referral-centre studies was 12\%-14\% (follow-up
               time, 12 years in one study; not reported in the second study).
               Complex perianal fistulas result in greatly diminished quality
               of life; up to 59\% of patients are at risk of faecal
               incontinence. Treatments include combinations of medical and
               surgical interventions and expanded allogeneic adipose-derived
               stem cells. High proportions of patients experience lack of or
               inadequate response to treatment (failure and relapse rates,

               0\%-50\%; stem cells: 29\%-47\% and not reported). Few studies
               (1 of infliximab; 3 of surgical interventions) have been
               conducted in treatment-refractory patients, a population with
               high unmet needs. Limited data exist on the clinical value of
               anti-tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ dose escalation in patients
               with complex perianal fistulas in CD. CONCLUSION: Complex
               perianal fistulas in CD pose substantial clinical and humanistic
               burden. There is a need for effective treatments, especially for
               patients refractory to anti-tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$
               agents, as evidenced by high failure and relapse rates.",

               PAF within the same month. Of the patients diagnosed with CD
               after PAF, approximately 30\% were diagnosed with PAF by the age
               of 20 years, whereas less than 10\% of PAF patients without CD
               were diagnosed with PAF by the age of 20 years. Conclusions: The
               study reveals the prevalence of CD-associated PAF in Japan and
               that most individuals were diagnosed with CD after the diagnosis
               of PAF. Crohn's disease may be underdiagnosed in patients with
               PAF; patients diagnosed with PAF at a young age should be
               monitored to allow timely diagnosis of CD.",

               disease (PCD) remains poorly described and is mainly based on
               retrospective studies from referral centers. The aim of this
               study was to assess the incidence, outcomes and predictors of
               the onset of PCD. METHODS: All incident cases of patients
               diagnosed with possible CD were prospectively registered from
               1994 to 1997 in Brittany, a limited area in France. At
               diagnosis, the clinical features of perianal disease were
               recorded. All patient charts were reviewed from the diagnosis to
               the last clinic visit in 2015. RESULTS: Among the 272 out of 331
               incident CD patients followed up, 51 (18.7\%) patients had PCD
               at diagnosis. After a mean follow-up of 12.8 years, 93 (34\%)
               patients developed PCD. The cumulative probabilities of perianal
               CD occurrence were 22\%, 29\%, and 32\% after 1 year, 5 years,
               and 10 years, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of anal
               ulceration were 14\%, and 19\% after 1 year and 10 years,
               respectively. Extraintestinal manifestations were associated
               with the occurrence of anal ulceration. The cumulative
               probabilities of fistulizing PCD were 11\%, 16\%, and 19\% after
               1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. Extraintestinal
               manifestations, rectal involvement and anal ulceration were
               predictors of fistulizing PCD. The cumulative probability of
               developing anal stricture was 4\% after 10 years. CONCLUSIONS:
               PCD is frequently observed during CD, in approximately one-third
               of patients. These data underline the need for targeted
               therapeutic research on primary perianal lesions (proctitis,
               anal ulceration) to avoid the onset of fistulizing perianal

               potentially severe phenotype of CD. We conducted a systematic
               review with meta-analysis to estimate cumulative incidence, risk
               factors, and outcomes of pCD in population-based cohort studies.
               METHODS: Through a systematic literature review through March 1,
               2021, we identified population-based inception cohort studies
               reporting cumulative incidence of perianal disease (primarily
               abscess and/or fistula) in patients with CD. We estimated the
               cumulative incidence of pCD at presentation and 1-, 5-, and
               10-year follow-up, and risk factors for perianal disease and
               outcomes including risk of major (bowel resection, proctectomy,
               ostomy) and minor perianal (incision and drainage, seton
               placement, etc.) surgery. RESULTS: In 12 population-based
               studies, prevalence of pCD was 18.7\% (95\% confidence interval
               [CI], 12.5\%-27.0\%) with 1-, 5-, and 10-year risk of perianal
               disease being 14.3\% (95\% CI, 7.9\%-24.6\%), 17.6\% (95\% CI,
               11.3\%-26.5\%), and 18.9\% (95\% CI, 15.0\%-23.4\%),
               respectively. Approximately 11.5\% of patients (95\% CI,
               6.7\%-19.0\%) had perianal disease at or before CD diagnosis.
               Colonic disease location and rectal involvement were associated
               with higher risk of pCD. Overall, 63.3\% of patients (95\% CI,
               53.3-72.3) required minor perianal surgery and 6.4\% of patients
               (95\% CI, 1.8\%-20.6\%) required major abdominal surgery for
               pCD. Use of biologic therapy for pCD is common and has steadily
               increased throughout the years. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in
               5 patients with CD develops perianal disease within 10 years of
               CD diagnosis, including 11.5\% who have perianal disease at
               presentation. Approximately two-thirds of patients require

  abstract  = "AIM: Combined infliximab and sphincter-sparing surgery can be
               effective in perianal fistula associated with Crohn's disease
               (CD). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of local surgery
               combined with infliximab on sustained fistula closure and to
               identify predictive factors for response after this combined
               treatment. METHOD: Between 2000 and 2010, 81 patients with
               fistulising perianal CD were included in this observational
               study. Drainage with a loose seton was followed by infliximab
               therapy. The primary end-points were the rate of complete
               fistula closure and time required for this to occur. RESULTS:
               The fistula was complex in 71 (88\%) of the 81 patients. Local
               proctological surgery was carried out in 77 (95\%), including
               seton drainage in 62 (80.5\%) of these. This was continued for a
               median duration of 3.8 months and the patient then received
               infliximab therapy. The median follow-up after treatment was 64
               months (2-263). Initial complete closure of the fistula occurred
               in 71 (88\%) cases at a median interval of 12.4 months (1-147)
               from the start of treatment. Recurrence was observed in 29
               (41\%) patients at a median interval of 38.5 months (2-48) from
               the start of treatment. They were treated again with combined
               treatment with successful closure in 19 (65.5\%) patients. The
               total rate of closure of the fistula was 75.3\%. Female gender,
               anal stenosis, rectovaginal and complex fistula formation were
               factors independently associated with failure of combined
               treatment. CONCLUSION: Seton drainage for several months
               combined with infliximab therapy is effective in closing the
               fistula in 75\% of patients with complex perianal fistula
               formation associated with CD.",

               designed to compare patients with Crohn's disease who underwent
               perianal fistula surgery with or without infliximab infusion.
               METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 226 consecutive
               patients with Crohn's disease who underwent operative treatment
               with or without infliximab (3-6 infusions of 5 mg/kg) from March

               and failure (persistent or recurrent symptomatic fistula,
               diverting procedure, or proctectomy). RESULTS: A total of 226
               patients underwent operative treatment alone (n = 147) or in
               combination with infliximab infusion (n = 79). Age, gender, and
               preoperative history of intestinal and perianal Crohn's disease
               were similar between groups. Mean follow-up was 30 (range,
               6-216) months. Operative treatment consisted of seton drainage
               (n = 112), conventional fistulotomy (n = 92), fibrin glue
               injection (n = 14), advancement flap (n = 5), collagen plug

               Eighty-eight patients (60 percent) healed completely with
               operative treatment alone, and 47 patients (59 percent) healed
               after operative treatment in combination with infliximab (P =

               fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease resulted in complete
               healing in approximately 60 percent of patients. Preoperative

               study was to analyze the rates of complete perianal remission
               after combined therapy for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.
               METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study with
               perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease patients submitted to
               combined therapy from four inflammatory bowel diseases referral

               Montreal classification, concomitant medication, classification
               of the fistulae, occurrence of perianal complete remission and
               recurrence after remission. Complete perianal remission was
               defined as absence of drainage from the fistulae associated with
               seton removal. DISCUSSION: A total of 78 patients were included,
               44 (55.8\%) females with a mean age of 33.8 ($\pm$15) years.
               Most patients were treated with Infliximab, 66.2\%, than with

               inflammatory bowel diseases. The disease has become more
               widespread and the rise in the incidence has been reported in
               all age groups including early childhood and according to recent
               data also the elderly population. Some earlier studies have
               suggested that the phenotype and natural history of the disease
               may be different according to age of onset. Recently the
               importance of age at onset was reported in two population-based
               studies from France and Hungary including both paediatric and
               adult onset inception cohorts. Early onset disease was
               associated with more frequent disease extension in both Crohn's
               disease and ulcerative colitis and in most but not all studies
               with higher frequency of complicated disease behaviour. This is
               also accompanied by striking differences in the medical

               well as ulcerative colitis are conflicting. Furthermore,
               published data indicate that relative but not absolute risk of
               developing cancer and mortality is higher in patients with an
               early onset disease. Critical reviews that focus on the
               importance of age at onset in inflammatory bowel disease are
               rare. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the
               differences in epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and
               natural history of paediatric and elderly-onset inflammatory
               bowel disease based on studies performed in general population.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Perianal Crohn's disease (pCD) occurs in up to 40\% of
              patients with CD and is associated with poor quality of life,
              limited treatment responses and poorly understood aetiology. We
              performed a genetic association study comparing CD subjects with
              and without perianal disease and subsequently performed
              functional follow-up studies for a pCD associated SNP in
              Complement Factor B (CFB). DESIGN: Immunochip-based meta-analysis
              on 4056 pCD and 11 088 patients with CD from three independent
              cohorts was performed. Serological and clinical variables were
              analysed by regression analyses. Risk allele of rs4151651 was
              introduced into human CFB plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis.
              Binding of recombinant G252 or S252 CFB to C3b and its cleavage
              was determined in cell-free assays. Macrophage phagocytosis in
              presence of recombinant CFB or serum from CFB risk, or protective
              CD or healthy subjects was assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS:
              Perianal complications were associated with colonic involvement,
              OmpC and ASCA serology, and serology quartile sum score. We
              identified a genetic association for pCD (rs4151651), a
              non-synonymous SNP (G252S) in CFB, in all three cohorts.
              Recombinant S252 CFB had reduced binding to C3b, its cleavage was
              impaired, and complement-driven phagocytosis and cytokine
              secretion were reduced compared with G252 CFB. Serine 252
              generates a de novo glycosylation site in CFB. Serum from
              homozygous risk patients displayed significantly decreased
              macrophage phagocytosis compared with non-risk serum. CONCLUSION:
              pCD-associated rs4151651 in CFB is a loss-of-function mutation
              that impairs its cleavage, activation of alternative complement
              pathway, and pathogen phagocytosis thus implicating the
              alternative complement pathway and CFB in pCD aetiology.",

               associated proctectomy rate in the prebiologic era vs the
               biologic era using a population-based cohort of Crohn's disease
               (CD) patients. METHODS: The medical records of 414 residents of
               Olmsted County, Minnesota, who were diagnosed with CD between
               1970 and 2010 were reviewed. The cumulative incidence of
               perianal or rectovaginal fistulas from time of CD diagnosis and
               the cumulative rate of proctectomy from date of first perianal
               or rectovaginal fistula diagnosis were estimated using the
               Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (20.5\%)
               diagnosed with CD between 1970 and 2010 had at least 1 perianal
               or rectovaginal fistula episode between January 1, 1970, and
               June 30, 2016. The cumulative incidence of perianal or
               rectovaginal fistulas was 18\% after 10 years, 23\% after 20
               years, and 24\% after 30-40 years from CD diagnosis. The
               cumulative incidence of perianal or rectovaginal fistulas was
               significantly lower in patients diagnosed in 1998 or after than
               in patients diagnosed before 1998 (P = 0.03, log-rank). Among 85
               patients developing perianal or rectovaginal fistulas, 16
               patients (18.8\%) underwent proctectomy for the treatment of
               perianal or rectovaginal fistulas during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
               In a population-based inception cohort of CD, one-fifth of
               patients were diagnosed with at least 1 perianal or rectovaginal

               challenging. As a result, the contribution of specific HLA
               alleles and amino-acid residues to the overall risk of SLE and
               to risk of specific autoantibodies are far from completely

               association followed by conditional analysis across HLA,

               protein-residue signals were stronger than allele signals and
               mapped predominantly to HLA-DRB1 residue 13 (P = 2.2x10-75) and
               its proxy position 11 (P = 1.1x10-67), followed by HLA-DRB1-37
               (P = 4.5x10-24). After conditioning on HLA-DRB1, novel
               associations at HLA-A-70 (P = 1.4x10-8), HLA-DPB1-35 (P =
               9.0x10-16), HLA-DQB1-37 (P = 2.7x10-14), and HLA-B-9 (P =
               6.5x10-15) emerged. Together, these seven residues increased the
               proportion of explained heritability due to HLA to 2.6\%. Risk
               residues for both overall disease and hallmark autoantibodies

               in the peptide-binding groove correlated with overall SLE risk
               and with autoantibody presence. Risk residues were in primarily
               negatively charged side-chains, in contrast with rheumatoid
               arthritis. We identified novel SLE signals in HLA Class I loci
               (HLA-A, HLA-B), and localized primary Class II signals to five
               residues in HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DQB1. These findings
               provide insights about the mechanisms by which the risk residues

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been
               widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex
               traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of
               familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well
               as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized)
               family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be
               routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis
               of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for
               relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating
               allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a
               strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This
               assumption is often untenable. RESULTS: Here, we present a rapid
               algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput
               genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of
               unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of
               individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of
               their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or
               population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation
               experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient
               power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated
               pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree
               relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap
               and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even
               under extreme population stratification, while algorithms
               assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased
               results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs
               relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a
               matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most
               efficient existing algorithm known to us. AVAILABILITY: Our

  abstract  = "Genome-wide association analysis of cohorts with thousands of
               phenotypes is computationally expensive, particularly when
               accounting for sample relatedness or population structure. Here
               we present a novel machine-learning method called REGENIE for
               fitting a whole-genome regression model for quantitative and
               binary phenotypes that is substantially faster than alternatives
               in multi-trait analyses while maintaining statistical
               efficiency. The method naturally accommodates parallel analysis
               of multiple phenotypes and requires only local segments of the
               genotype matrix to be loaded in memory, in contrast to existing
               alternatives, which must load genome-wide matrices into memory.
               This results in substantial savings in compute time and memory
               usage. We introduce a fast, approximate Firth logistic
               regression test for unbalanced case-control phenotypes. The
               method is ideally suited to take advantage of distributed
               computing frameworks. We demonstrate the accuracy and
               computational benefits of this approach using the UK Biobank
               dataset with up to 407,746 individuals.",

               resource of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data consented for

               final, phase 3 release of the 1kGP included 2,504 unrelated
               samples from 26 populations and was based primarily on
               low-coverage WGS. Here, we present a high-coverage 3,202-sample
               WGS 1kGP resource, which now includes 602 complete trios,
               sequenced to a depth of 30X using Illumina. We performed
               single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and short insertion and deletion
               (INDEL) discovery and generated a comprehensive set of
               structural variants (SVs) by integrating multiple analytic
               methods through a machine learning model. We show gains in
               sensitivity and precision of variant calls compared to phase 3,
               especially among rare SNVs as well as INDELs and SVs spanning
