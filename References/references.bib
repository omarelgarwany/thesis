  abstract  = "Phylogenetics is a powerful tool for analyzing protein
               sequences, by inferring their evolutionary relationships to
               other proteins. However, phylogenetics analyses can be
               challenging: they are computationally expensive and must be
               performed carefully in order to avoid systematic errors and
               artifacts. Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships
               (PANTHER; http://pantherdb.org) is a publicly available,
               user-focused knowledgebase that stores the results of an
               extensive phylogenetic reconstruction pipeline that includes
               computational and manual processes and quality control steps.
               First, fully reconciled phylogenetic trees (including ancestral
               protein sequences) are reconstructed for a set of ``reference''
               protein sequences obtained from fully sequenced genomes of
               organisms across the tree of life. Second, the resulting
               phylogenetic trees are manually reviewed and annotated with
               function evolution events: inferred gains and losses of protein
               function along branches of the phylogenetic tree. Here, we
               describe in detail the current contents of PANTHER, how those
               contents are generated, and how they can be used in a variety of
               applications. The PANTHER knowledgebase can be downloaded or
               accessed via an extensive API. In addition, PANTHER provides
               software tools to facilitate the application of the
               knowledgebase to common protein sequence analysis tasks:
               exploring an annotated genome by gene function; performing
               ``enrichment analysis'' of lists of genes; annotating a single
               sequence or large batch of sequences by homology; and assessing
               the likelihood that a genetic variant at a particular site in a
               protein will have deleterious effects.",

               identify susceptibility loci for complex diseases such as

               observed in Central Asia and the lowest in East Asia and
               Northwestern Europe. Interestingly, we observed a North-to-South
               decline of European gene flow in East Asians, suggesting a
               northern path of European gene flow diffusing into East Asian

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Haemorrhoidal disease (HEM) affects a large and
               silently suffering fraction of the population but its aetiology,
               including suspected genetic predisposition, is poorly
               understood. We report the first genome-wide association study
               (GWAS) meta-analysis to identify genetic risk factors for HEM to
               date. DESIGN: We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of 218 920
               patients with HEM and 725 213 controls of European ancestry.
               Using GWAS summary statistics, we performed multiple genetic
               correlation analyses between HEM and other traits as well as
               calculated HEM polygenic risk scores (PRS) and evaluated their
               translational potential in independent datasets. Using
               functional annotation of GWAS results, we identified HEM
               candidate genes, which differential expression and coexpression
               in HEM tissues were evaluated employing RNA-seq analyses. The
               localisation of expressed proteins at selected loci was
               investigated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We demonstrate
               modest heritability and genetic correlation of HEM with several
               other diseases from the GI, neuroaffective and cardiovascular
               domains. HEM PRS validated in 180 435 individuals from
               independent datasets allowed the identification of those at risk
               and correlated with younger age of onset and recurrent surgery.
               We identified 102 independent HEM risk loci harbouring genes
               whose expression is enriched in blood vessels and GI tissues,
               and in pathways associated with smooth muscles, epithelial and
               endothelial development and morphogenesis. Network
               transcriptomic analyses highlighted HEM gene coexpression
               modules that are relevant to the development and integrity of
               the musculoskeletal and epidermal systems, and the organisation
               of the extracellular matrix. CONCLUSION: HEM has a genetic
               component that predisposes to smooth muscle, epithelial and
               connective tissue dysfunction.",

              these variants may regulate expression in specific biological
              contexts, such as stimulated immune cells. Here, we used human
              iPSC-derived macrophages to map eQTLs across 24 cellular
              conditions. We found that 76\% of eQTLs detected in at least one
              stimulated condition were also found in naive cells. The
              percentage of response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied widely across
              conditions (3.7\% - 28.4\%), with reQTLs specific to a single
              condition being rare (1.11\%). Despite their relative rarity,
              reQTLs were overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs. We
              nominated an additional 21.7\% of disease effector genes at GWAS

               deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitive sites (DHSs).
               Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal

               systematically perturb transcription factor recognition

               regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective

               identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated
               with a large number of phenotypes. However, an associated SNP is
               likely part of a larger region of linkage disequilibrium. This
               makes it difficult to precisely identify the SNPs that have a
               biological link with the phenotype. We have systematically
               investigated the association of multiple types of ENCODE data
               with disease-associated SNPs and show that there is significant
               enrichment for functional SNPs among the currently identified

               multiple sources of functional information and when highest
               confidence disease-associated SNPs are used. We propose an
               approach that integrates multiple types of functional data
               generated by the ENCODE Consortium to help identify ``functional
               SNPs'' that may be associated with the disease phenotype. Our

               most associations, the functional SNP most strongly supported by
               experimental evidence is a SNP in linkage disequilibrium with
               the reported association rather than the reported SNP itself.
               Our results show that the experimental data sets generated by

               and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses
               using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through
               the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88\% of genes,
               and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL
               (detected for 37\% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested)
               showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication
               power and confounding by cell type composition. However,
               replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized
               intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via
               several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by
               transcription factors. Expression of 13\% of the genes
               correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes,
               pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this
               work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as
               a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex
               phenotypes.",

               expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), thus suggesting that
               most risk variants alter gene expression. However, because
               causal variants are difficult to identify, and cis-eQTLs occur
               frequently, it remains challenging to identify specific
               instances of disease-relevant changes to gene regulation. Here,
               we used a novel joint likelihood framework with higher
               resolution than that of previous methods to identify loci where
               autoimmune-disease risk and an eQTL are driven by a single

  abstract = "AbstractMost signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
              complex traits point to noncoding genetic variants with putative
              gene regulatory effects. However, currently identified expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a small fraction of
              GWAS signals. By analyzing GWAS hits for complex traits in the UK
              Biobank, and cis-eQTLs from the GTEx consortium, we show that
              these assays systematically discover different types of genes and
              variants: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites,
              while GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in
              numerous functional annotations, are under strong selective
              constraint and have a complex regulatory landscape across
              different tissue/cell types, while genes near eQTLs are depleted
              of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have
              simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand
              these observations, including how natural selection on complex
              traits hinders discovery of functionally-relevant eQTLs. Our
              results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically
              biased toward different types of variants, and support the use of
              complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation
              of eQTL studies.",

               RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) sense viral RNA and signal through
               the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor MAVS (also known
               as IPS-1, Cardif and VISA) whose activation triggers a rapid
               production of type I interferons (IFN) and of pro-inflammatory
               cytokines through the transcription factors IRF3/IRF7 and
               NF-$\kappa$B, respectively. While MAVS is essential for this
               signaling and known to operate through the scaffold protein NEMO
               and the protein kinase TBK1 that phosphorylates IRF3, its
               mechanism of action and regulation remain unclear. RESULTS: We
               report here that RLR activation triggers MAVS ubiquitination on
               lysine 7 and 10 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and marks it
               for proteasomal degradation concomitantly with downstream
               signaling. Inhibition of this MAVS degradation with a proteasome
               inhibitor does not affect NF-$\kappa$B signaling but it hampers
               IRF3 activation, and NEMO and TBK1, two essential mediators in
               type I IFN production, are retained at the mitochondria.
               CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MAVS functions as a
               recruitment platform that assembles a signaling complex
               involving NEMO and TBK1, and that the proteasome-mediated MAVS
               degradation is required to release the signaling complex into
               the cytosol, allowing IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1.",

               key innate immune cells that upon encountering
               pathogen-associated molecular patterns respond by producing
               cytokines, including IFN-$\beta$. In this study, we identify a
               novel role for RIPK1 and RIPK3, a pair of homologous
               serine/threonine kinases previously implicated in the regulation
               of necroptosis and pathologic tissue injury, in directing
               IFN-$\beta$ production in macrophages. Using genetic and
               pharmacologic tools, we show that catalytic activity of RIPK1
               directs IFN-$\beta$ synthesis induced by LPS in mice.
               Additionally, we report that RIPK1 kinase-dependent IFN-$\beta$
               production may be elicited in an analogous fashion using LPS in
               bone marrow-derived macrophages upon inhibition of caspases.
               Notably, this regulation requires kinase activities of both
               RIPK1 and RIPK3, but not the necroptosis effector protein, MLKL.
               Mechanistically, we provide evidence that necrosome-like RIPK1
               and RIPK3 aggregates facilitate canonical TRIF-dependent
               IFN-$\beta$ production downstream of the LPS receptor TLR4.
               Intriguingly, we also show that RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase-dependent
               synthesis of IFN-$\beta$ is markedly induced by avirulent
               strains of Gram-negative bacteria, Yersinia and Klebsiella, and
               less so by their wild-type counterparts. Overall, these
               observations identify unexpected roles for RIPK1 and RIPK3
               kinases in the production of IFN-$\beta$ during the host
               inflammatory responses to bacterial infection and suggest that
               the axis in which these kinases operate may represent a target

  abstract  = "The mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein (MAVS), also
               known as CARDIF, IPS-1, KIAA1271 and VISA, is a mitochondria
               associated protein that regulates type I interferon production
               through coordinated activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3. The
               N-terminal CARD domain of MAVS interacts with RIGI helicase of
               upcapped RNA detection and the putative TRAF2 and TRAF6 binding
               motifs modulate protein interaction for NF-kappaB activation.
               MAVS is encoded by a single gene composed of 6 exons but is
               generally detected as multiple protein bands after separation by
               SDS-PAGE. In an effort to identify MAVS variants with diverse
               biological functions, we isolated three splicing variants and
               named them MAVS 1a (exon 2 deletion), 1b (exon 3 deletion) and
               1c (exon 6 deletion), respectively. MAVS 1a and 1b, due to a
               frame shift by exon deletion, encode 131 and 124 aa residues,
               respectively. Except the first 39 aa residues encoded by exon 1,
               MAVS 1a does not share sequence homology with known proteins, it
               instead contains a putative TRAF2-binding motif and interacts
               with TRAF2 and RIP1. MAVS 1b shares the first 97 residues with
               wt MAVS and 27 aa residues of unknown protein. Unlike MAVS that
               activates both NF-kappaB and IRF3 pathways, expression of MAVS
               1b selectively activates an IFNbeta but not an IL8 promoter.
               MAVS 1b interacts with RIP1 and FADD and exhibits anti-viral
               activity against VSV infection. This study uncovers MAVS
               splicing variants of diverse biological function.",

               understudied. Given their crucial role in regulating pre-mRNA

               members of the SR/hnRNP protein families regulate innate immune

               expression and alternatively spliced isoform production in ten
               SR/hnRNP knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell lines
               following infection with the bacterial pathogen Salmonella
               enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella). We identified
               thousands of transcripts whose abundance is increased or
               decreased by SR/hnRNP knockdown in macrophages. Notably, we
               observed that SR and hnRNP proteins influence expression of
               different genes in uninfected versus Salmonella-infected
               macrophages, suggesting functionalization of these proteins upon
               pathogen sensing. Likewise, we found that knockdown of SR/hnRNPs
               promoted differential isoform usage (DIU) for thousands of
               macrophage transcripts and that these alternative splicing
               changes were distinct in uninfected and Salmonella-infected
               macrophages. Finally, having observed a surprising degree of
               similarity between the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and
               DIUs in hnRNP K and U knockdown macrophages, we found that hnRNP
               K and U knockdown macrophages are both more restrictive to
               Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), while hnRNP K knockdown
               macrophages are more permissive to Salmonella Typhimurium. Based
               on these findings, we conclude that many innate immune genes
               evolved to rely on one or more SR/hnRNPs to ensure the proper
               magnitude of their induction, supporting a model wherein
               pre-mRNA splicing is critical for regulating innate immune gene

               when hundreds of thousands of association tests are conducted.
               The power to detect genetic effects is dependent on minor allele
               frequency (MAF), and genome-wide association studies SNP arrays
               include SNPs with a wide distribution of MAFs. Therefore, it is
               critical to understand MAF's effect on the false positive
               rate.Data from the Framingham Heart Study simulated data
               (Problem 3, with answers) was used to examine the effects of
               varying MAFs on the likelihood of false positives. Replication
               set 1 was used to generate 1 million permutations of
               case/control status in unrelated individuals. Logistic
               regression was used to test for the association between each SNP
               and myocardial infarction using an additive model. We report the
               number of ``significant'' tests by MAF at alpha = 10-4, 10-5,
               and 10-6.Common SNPs exhibited fewer false positives than
               expected. At alpha = 10-4, SNPs with MAF 25\% and 50\% resulted
               in 69.2 [95\%CI: 62.8-75.6] and 70.8 [95\%CI: 61.3-80.4] false
               positives, respectively, compared to 100 expected. Rare SNPs
               exhibited more variability but did not show more false-positive
               results than expected by chance. However, at alpha = 10-4, MAF =
               5\% exhibited significantly more false positives (105.5 [95\%CI:
               81-130.1]) than MAF = 25\% and 50\%. Similar results were seen
               at the other alpha values.These results suggest that removal of

               macrophage polarization in vitro greatly contributes to our
               understanding of macrophage biology. Macrophages are divided

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Exposure of macrophages to bacterial products such
               as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in activation of the
               NF-kappaB transcription factor, which orchestrates a gene
               expression programme that underpins the macrophage-dependent
               immune response. These changes include the induction or
               repression of a wide range of genes that regulate inflammation,
               cell proliferation, migration and cell survival. This process is
               tightly regulated and loss of control is associated with
               conditions such as septic shock, inflammatory diseases and
               cancer. To study this response, it is important to have in vitro
               model systems that reflect the behaviour of cells in vivo. In
               addition, it is necessary to understand the natural differences
               that can occur between individuals. In this report, we have
               investigated and compared the LPS response in macrophage derived
               cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) derived
               macrophages. RESULTS: Gene expression profiles were determined
               following LPS treatment of THP-1 cells for 1 and 4 hours. LPS
               significantly induced or repressed 72 out of 465 genes selected
               as being known or putative NF-kappaB target genes, which
               exhibited 4 temporal patterns of expression. Results for 34 of
               these genes, including several genes not previously identified
               as LPS target genes, were validated using real time PCR. A high
               correlation between microarray and real time PCR data was found.
               Significantly, the LPS induced expression profile of THP-1
               cells, as determined using real time PCR, was found to be very
               similar to that of human PBMC derived macrophages.
               Interestingly, some differences were observed in the LPS
               response between the two donor PBMC macrophage populations.
               Surprisingly, we found that the LPS response in U937 cells was
               dramatically different to both THP-1 and PBMC derived
               macrophages. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a dynamic and
               diverse transcriptional response to LPS in macrophages,
               involving both the induction and repression of gene expression
               in a time dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrated that the
               LPS induced transcriptional response in the THP-1 cell line is
               very similar to primary PBMC derived macrophages. Therefore,
               THP-1 cells represent a good model system for studying the
               mechanisms of LPS and NF-kappaB dependent gene expression.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a heritable
               connective tissue disorder characterized by hyperextensible
               skin, joint hypermobility and soft tissue fragility. The classic
               subtype of EDS is caused by mutations in one of the type V
               collagen genes (COL5A1 and COL5A2). Most mutations affect the
               type V collagen helical domain and lead to a diminished or
               structurally abnormal type V collagen protein. Remarkably, only
               two mutations were reported to affect the extended, highly
               conserved N-propeptide domain, which plays an important role in
               the regulation of the heterotypic collagen fibril diameter. We
               identified a novel COL5A1 N-propeptide mutation, resulting in an
               unusual but severe classic EDS phenotype and a remarkable
               splicing outcome. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified
               a novel COL5A1 N-propeptide acceptor-splice site mutation
               (IVS6-2A>G, NM\_000093.3\_c.925-2A>G) in a patient with
               cutaneous features of EDS, severe progressive scoliosis and eye
               involvement. Two mutant transcripts were identified, one with an
               exon 7 skip and one in which exon 7 and the upstream exon 6 are
               deleted. Both transcripts are expressed and secreted into the
               extracellular matrix, where they can participate in and perturb
               collagen fibrillogenesis, as illustrated by the presence of
               dermal collagen cauliflowers. Determination of the order of
               intron removal and computational analysis showed that
               simultaneous skipping of exons 6 and 7 is due to the combined
               effect of delayed splicing of intron 7, altered pre-mRNA
               secondary structure, low splice site strength and possibly
               disturbed binding of splicing factors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
               We report a novel COL5A1 N-propeptide acceptor-splice site
               mutation in intron 6, which not only affects splicing of the
               adjacent exon 7, but also causes a splicing error of the
               upstream exon 6. Our findings add further insights into the
               COL5A1 splicing order and show for the first time that a single
               COL5A1 acceptor-splice site mutation can perturb splicing of the
               upstream exon.",

               editing of three different rare CFTR mutations which together
               account for about 3\% of individuals with Cystic Fibrosis. The
               mutations cause aberrant splicing of CFTR mRNA due to the
               creation of cryptic splice signals that result in the formation
               of pseudoexons containing premature stop codons c.1679+1634A>G

               mutation which resulted in high efficiency excision of the
               target genomic regions via non-homologous end-joining repair.
               When evaluated in a mini-gene splicing assay, we showed that

               the extent of alternative splicing in human cells using deep RNA
               sequencing and de novo identification of splice junctions. We
               demonstrate the existence of a large class of low abundance

               unannotated splice junctions in our data. Newly-identified
               splice sites show little evidence of evolutionary conservation,
               suggesting that the majority are due to erroneous splice site
               choice. We show that sequence motifs involved in the recognition
               of exons are enriched in the vicinity of unconserved splice
               sites. We estimate that the average intron has a splicing error
               rate of approximately 0.7\% and show that introns in highly
               expressed genes are spliced more accurately, likely due to their

               homeostasis and direct lymphocyte activation. By
               dephosphorylating tyrosine residues, PTPs have been shown to
               modulate enzyme activity and both mediate and disrupt
               protein-protein interactions. Through these molecular
               mechanisms, PTPs ultimately impact lymphocyte responses to
               environmental cues such as inflammatory cytokines and
               chemokines, as well as antigenic stimulation. Mouse models of
               acute and chronic intestinal inflammation have been shown to be
               exacerbated in the absence of PTPs such as PTPN2 and PTPN22.
               This increase in disease severity is due in part to
               hyper-activation of lymphocytes in the absence of PTP activity.
               In accordance, human PTPs have been linked to intestinal

               several PTPs within risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease

               few weeks after birth because of systemic inflammation and
               severe colitis. However, the tissues, cells, and molecular
               mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype remain unclear.
               Here, we demonstrate that myeloid cell-specific deletion of
               PTPN2 in mice (PTPN2-LysMCre) promotes intestinal inflammation
               but protects from colitis-associated tumor formation in an
               IL-1$\beta$-dependent manner. Elevated levels of mature
               IL-1$\beta$ production in PTPN2-LysMCre mice are a consequence
               of increased inflammasome assembly due to elevated
               phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Thus,
               we have identified a dual role for myeloid PTPN2 in directly
               regulating inflammasome activation and IL-1$\beta$ production to
               suppress pro-inflammatory responses during colitis but promote
               intestinal tumor development.",

               cells that are often divided into two major subsets: classically

               mediate host defense, and alternatively activated,
               tolerance-inducing (M2) macrophages that exert homeostatic and
               tissue-regenerative functions. Disturbed macrophage
               function/differentiation results either in inadequate, excessive
               immune activation or in a failure to induce efficient protective
               immune responses against pathogens. Loss-of-function variants in

               associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, but the effect
               of macrophage-intrinsic PTPN2 loss is still poorly understood.
               Here we report that PTPN2-deficient macrophages fail to acquire
               an alternatively activated/M2 phenotype. This was the
               consequence of reduced IL-6 receptor expression and a failure to
               induce IL-4 receptor in response to IL-6, resulting in an
               inability to respond to the key M2-inducing cytokine IL-4.
               Ultimately, failure to adequately respond to IL-6 and IL-4
               resulted in increased levels of M1 macrophage marker expression
               in vitro and exacerbated lung inflammation upon infection with

               that PTPN2 loss interferes with the ability of macrophages to
               adequately respond to inflammatory stimuli and might explain the
               increased susceptibility of PTPN2 loss-of-function carriers to

               degradation. This traditional outlook has been substantially
               modified in recent years by discoveries that endocytosis and
               subsequent trafficking routes have a profound impact on the
               positive regulation and propagation of signals, being key for
               the spatiotemporal regulation of signal transmission in cells.
               Accordingly, endocytosis and membrane trafficking regulate
               virtually every aspect of cell physiology and are frequently
               subverted in pathological conditions. Two key aspects of
               endocytic control over signalling are coming into focus:
               context-dependency and long-range effects. First,
               endocytic-regulated outputs are not stereotyped but heavily
               dependent on the cell-specific regulation of endocytic networks.
               Second, endocytic regulation has an impact not only on
               individual cells but also on the behaviour of cellular
               collectives. Herein, we will discuss recent advancements in
               these areas, highlighting how endocytic trafficking impacts
               complex cell properties, including cell polarity and collective

               perform a comprehensive characterization of the putative
               mechanisms by which GWAS loci impact human immune traits. By
               harmonizing four major immune QTL studies, we identify 26,271
               expression QTLs (eQTLs) and 23,121 splicing QTLs (sQTLs)
               spanning 18 immune cell types. Our colocalization analyses
               between QTLs and trait-associated loci from 72 GWAS reveals that
               genetic effects on RNA expression and splicing in immune cells
               colocalize with 40.4\% of GWAS loci for immune-related traits,
               in many cases increasing the fraction of colocalized loci by two
               fold compared to previous studies. Notably, we find that the
               largest contributors of this increase are splicing QTLs, which
               colocalize on average with 14\% of all GWAS loci that do not

  author    = "Melamud, Eugene and Moult, John",
  abstract  = "Even though nearly every human gene has at least one alternative
               splice form, very little is so far known about the structure and
               function of resulting protein products. It is becoming
               increasingly clear that a significant fraction of all isoforms
               are products of noisy selection of splice sites and thus
               contribute little to actual functional diversity, and may
               potentially be deleterious. In this study, we examine the impact
               of alternative splicing on protein sequence and structure in
               three datasets: alternative splicing events conserved across
               multiple species, alternative splicing events in genes that are
               strongly linked to disease and all observed alternative splicing
               events. We find that the vast majority of all alternative
               isoforms result in unstable protein conformations. In contrast
               to that, the small subset of isoforms conserved across species
               tends to maintain protein structural integrity to a greater
               extent. Alternative splicing in disease-associated genes
               produces unstable structures just as frequently as all other
               genes, indicating that selection to reduce the effects of
               alternative splicing on this set is not especially pronounced.
               Overall, the properties of alternative spliced proteins are
               consistent with the outcome of noisy selection of splice sites
               by splicing machinery.",

               cellular differentiation and a driver of complexity in mammalian

               differentially used or expressed and how this affects cellular
               differentiation remains unclear. Long read sequencing allows
               full-length transcript recovery and quantification, enabling
               transcript-level analysis of alternative splicing processes and
               how these change with cell state. Here, we utilise Oxford

               is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
               non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
               lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
               technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
               high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
               limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
               billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
               the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
               based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
               that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in
               uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and
               stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor
               of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550
               million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
               12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment
               sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo
               detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover
               non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is
               also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche
               454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain
               reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel
               intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate,
               corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.
               AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a
               standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software

               commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) seems to
               play an important role in the pathogenesis of fistulae, a common
               clinical complication of Crohn's disease (CD). TGF$\beta$ and
               interleukin-13 (IL-13) have been correlated with the onset of
               EMT-associated organ fibrosis and high levels of TGF$\beta$ have
               been shown in transitional cells (TCs) lining CD fistula tracts.
               This study investigated whether IL-13 could be involved in the
               pathogenesis of CD-associated fistulae. DESIGN: Protein or mRNA
               levels in HT29 intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or colonic
               lamina propria fibroblasts (CLPFs) were studied by western
               blotting or real-time PCR. CLPFs were isolated from
               non-inflammatory disease controls or patients with CD with or
               without fistulae and IL-13 levels were analysed in surgically
               removed fistula specimens by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:
               TGF$\beta$ induced IL-13 secretion in CLPFs from patients with
               fistulising CD. In fistula specimens high levels of IL-13 were
               detected in TCs covering fistula tracts. In HT29 IEC monolayers,
               IL-13 induced SLUG and $\beta$6-integrin mRNA, which are
               associated with cell invasion. HT29 spheroids completely
               disintegrated when treated with TGF$\beta$ for 7 days, whereas
               IL-13-treated spheroids did not show morphological changes.
               Here, TGF$\beta$ induced mRNA expression of SNAIL1 and IL-13,
               whereas IL-13 elevated SLUG and $\beta$6-integrin mRNA. An
               anti-IL-13 antibody was able to prevent IL-13-induced SLUG
               expression in HT29 IECs. CONCLUSIONS: TGF$\beta$ induces IL-13
               expression and an EMT-like phenotype of IECs, while IL-13
               promotes the expression of genes associated with cell invasion.
               These findings suggest that TGF$\beta$ and IL-13 play a
               synergistic role in the pathogenesis of fistulae and inhibition
               of IL-13 might represent a novel therapeutic approach for
               fistula treatment.",

               the disease course. First, they help define the end points for
               clinical trials that are designed to test drugs for the end
               point of disease modification in chronic disabling diseases.
               Natural history studies can also help to identify subsets of
               patients in whom the disease prognosis can be stratified
               according to clinical features. This comprehensive review
               summarizes our current knowledge of the natural history of
               Crohn's disease in adults as reported in population-based
               studies that include long-term follow-up results. METHODS: We
               conducted a literature search of English and non-English
               language publications listed in the electronic databases of
               MEDLINE (source PUBMED, 1935 to December 2008). RESULTS:
               One-third of the patients had ileitis, colitis, or ileocolitis
               at the time of diagnosis. Disease location remained broadly
               stable over time. Up to one-third of the patients had evidence
               of a stricturing or penetrating intestinal complication at
               diagnosis, and half of all patients had experienced an
               intestinal complication within 20 years after diagnosis. Ten
               percent of the patients had prolonged clinical remission.
               Steroid dependency occurred in one-third of the patients, and
               surgery was required in one-third after initiation of steroid
               therapy. The annual incidence of hospitalizations was 20\%. Half
               of the patients required surgery within 10 years after
               diagnosis. The risk of postoperative recurrence was 44-55\%
               after 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Crohn's disease is a disabling
               condition over time. The impact of changing treatment paradigms
               with increased use of immunosuppressants and biological agents
               on its natural history is poorly known.",

  abstract  = "Fistulas still represent one of the most important complications
               in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). At least one third of CD
               patients suffer from fistulas during their disease course and
               amongst them longstanding remission of complex fistulas occurs
               only in about one third. So far, fistula pathogenesis is only
               partially understood. From a histopathological view, a fistula
               is a tube covered by flat epithelial cells. Current research
               suggests that the driving force for fistula development is
               epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Around the fistula,
               high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-13, and
               TGF$\beta$ can be detected and recent studies indicated an
               involvement of the intestinal microbiota. Fistula diagnosis
               requires clinical and surgical assessment, radiologic
               investigations, e.g., magnet resonance imaging and endoscopy.
               Routine medical treatment of fistulas includes antibiotics,
               immunosuppressives, and anti-TNF antibodies. There is no
               well-established role for calcineurin inhibitors in fistula
               treatment, corticosteroids appear to be even contra-productive.
               A promising novel approach might be the application of adipose
               tissue-derived or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
               that have been studied recently. Due to insufficient efficacy of
               medical treatment and recurrence of fistulas, surgical
               interventions are frequently necessary. Further research is
               needed to better understand fistula pathogenesis aiming to
               develop novel treatment option for our patients.",

               conducted in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. PATIENTS: All
               patients with IBD in Canterbury, New Zealand, were eligible for
               recruitment over a 3-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
               clinical records of all patients with Crohn's disease were
               reviewed, and all symptomatic perianal disease was classified
               according to the American Gastroenterological Society position

               relative to Crohn's diagnosis was determined. RESULTS:
               Ninety-one percent of IBD patients in the region were recruited.
               Seven hundred fifteen patients had Crohn's disease, of which 190
               (26.6\%) patients had symptomatic perianal disease. The median
               age of patients with perianal disease was 37 years (range, 4-82
               years) and 58.4\% were female. Median follow-up was 9 years
               (range, 2 months to 45 years) from Crohn's disease diagnosis.
               Onset of perianal disease ranged from 18 years pre-Crohn's
               diagnosis to 33 years post-Crohn's diagnosis. Fistulas were the
               most common lesion (50\% of patients), followed by perianal
               abscesses (42.1\%), fissures (32.6\%), skin tags (11.1\%),
               strictures (7.4\%), and hemorrhoids (1.6\%). The cumulative
               probability at 20 years of any perianal Crohn's disease was
               42.7\% and of a perianal fistula 28.3\%. LIMITATIONS: This study

To assess the degree of impairment and response to therapy, we identified five simple elements and graded each on a 5-point Likert scale in 37 patients at 124 visits. At each visit a Crohn's Disease (CDAI) or Simple Activity Index (HBDAI), Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), and treatment were recorded. The PDAI was validated against physician (MDGA) and patient (PGA) global assessments, and treatment was prescribed for the perianal disease. Measurement error was evaluated in 19 patients who were clinically stable at two consecutive visits. The ability of the PDAI to detect important clinical change was tested in 20 subjects exhibiting a change on PGA at consecutive visits. There were strong correlations between PDAI, MDGA, and PGA scores at all visits (R = 0.66-0.72; p &lt; 0.001), whereas the CDAI and HBDAI correlated poorly with PDAI (R &lt; 0.23). Physicians prescribed more aggressive therapy for higher PDAI scores (r = 0.53). Mean PDAI scores between visits in clinically stable subjects were not significantly different [5.58 +/- 2.79 (initial); 5.42 +/- 2.55 (follow-up); p = 0.63]. PDAI significantly improved between visits when the perianal disease had improved (PDAI score difference 3.05 +/- 2.96; P = .0002). We conclude that the PDAI is simple and clinically useful for patient management. It should now be assessed in a clinical trial.},

               diagnosis to 33 years post-Crohn's diagnosis. Fistulas were the
               most common lesion (50\% of patients), followed by perianal
               abscesses (42.1\%), fissures (32.6\%), skin tags (11.1\%),
               strictures (7.4\%), and hemorrhoids (1.6\%). The cumulative
               probability at 20 years of any perianal Crohn's disease was
               42.7\% and of a perianal fistula 28.3\%. LIMITATIONS: This study
               assumed all noted perianal lesions were related to Crohn's
               disease and the retrospective classification may have been
               inaccurate in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the
               first detailed classification of perianal Crohn's disease in a
               population-based cohort.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Perianal fistulas are a challenging manifestation of
               Crohn's disease. Best medical and surgical therapy results in
               only about a third of patients remaining in remission at one
               year on maintenance treatment and sustained healing is often
               elusive. There is little published data on patient perspective
               of living with the condition or coping strategies in the face of
               non-curative/non-definitive treatment. We aimed to understand
               the experience of living with perianal fistula(s) and their
               impact on quality of life and routine functioning. METHODS: This
               exploratory qualitative study used purposive sampling to recruit
               participants with current / previous diagnosis of Crohn's anal
               fistulas, from national IBD / bowel disease charities. The
               ``standards for reporting qualitative research'' (SRQR)
               recommendations were followed. Unstructured individual
               face-to-face interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and
               analysed thematically. Early themes were reviewed by the study
               team including patient advocates, clinicians and qualitative
               researchers. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were conducted,
               achieving apparent data saturation. Three broad themes were
               uncovered: Burden of symptoms; Burden of treatment; and Impact
               on emotional, physical and social well-being. Each included
               several sub-themes, with considerable interplay between these.
               The impact of perianal fistula(s) on patients with CD is intense
               and wide reaching, negatively affecting intimate, close and
               social relationships. Fistulas cause losses in life and
               work-related opportunities, and treatments can be difficult to
               tolerate. CONCLUSION: Crohn's perianal fistulas exert a heavy
               negative physical and emotional impact on patients. These
               findings will inform development of a patient reported outcome
               measure to assess treatment effectiveness and quality of life
               for patients living with this challenging condition.",

               disease burden, and treatment outcomes for Crohn's disease (CD)
               patients with complex perianal fistulas. METHODS: PubMed,
               Embase, and Cochrane were searched for relevant articles
               (published 2000-November 2016) and congress abstracts (published
               2011-November 2016). RESULTS: Of 535 records reviewed, 62
               relevant sources were identified (mostly small observational
               studies). The cumulative incidence of complex perianal fistulas
               in CD from two referral-centre studies was 12\%-14\% (follow-up
               time, 12 years in one study; not reported in the second study).
               Complex perianal fistulas result in greatly diminished quality
               of life; up to 59\% of patients are at risk of faecal
               incontinence. Treatments include combinations of medical and
               surgical interventions and expanded allogeneic adipose-derived
               stem cells. High proportions of patients experience lack of or
               inadequate response to treatment (failure and relapse rates,
               respectively: medical, 12\%-73\% and 0\%-41\%; surgical:
               0\%-100\% and 11\%-20\%; combined medical/surgical: 0\%-80\% and
               0\%-50\%; stem cells: 29\%-47\% and not reported). Few studies
               (1 of infliximab; 3 of surgical interventions) have been
               conducted in treatment-refractory patients, a population with
               high unmet needs. Limited data exist on the clinical value of
               anti-tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ dose escalation in patients
               with complex perianal fistulas in CD. CONCLUSION: Complex
               perianal fistulas in CD pose substantial clinical and humanistic
               burden. There is a need for effective treatments, especially for
               patients refractory to anti-tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$
               agents, as evidenced by high failure and relapse rates.",

               East Asia experiencing a more than doubled increase in IBD
               prevalence over the past decade. Historically, ulcerative

               However, a reverse trend is beginning to appear in more
               developed countries in Asia such as Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong.
               While Asian IBD patients share many similarities with their
               Western counterparts, there are important differences with
               significant clinical implications. In Asia, there are more men

               aggregation, fewer extra-intestinal manifestations and worse
               clinical outcomes for older-onset patients with UC. These

               of Crohn's disease (CD) which greatly impacts the quality of
               life. To address a scarcity of data in Asian populations, we
               determined the prevalence of CD-associated PAF in Japan, the
               order of diagnosis, and medical history of patients. Methods: A
               retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study was
               conducted, using an employer-based health insurance claims
               database. The study included patients diagnosed with CD and/or
               PAF from October 2013 to September 2019. Results: The age- and
               gender-adjusted prevalence rates of CD-associated PAF increased
               from 10.33 per 100 000 in 2014, to 13.68 per 100 000 in 2019.
               Among patients with CD-associated PAF, 15.7\% were diagnosed
               with PAF after diagnosis of CD, 68.6\% were diagnosed with PAF
               before diagnosis with CD, and 15.7\% were diagnosed with CD and
               PAF within the same month. Of the patients diagnosed with CD
               after PAF, approximately 30\% were diagnosed with PAF by the age
               of 20 years, whereas less than 10\% of PAF patients without CD
               were diagnosed with PAF by the age of 20 years. Conclusions: The
               study reveals the prevalence of CD-associated PAF in Japan and
               that most individuals were diagnosed with CD after the diagnosis
               of PAF. Crohn's disease may be underdiagnosed in patients with
               PAF; patients diagnosed with PAF at a young age should be
               monitored to allow timely diagnosis of CD.",

               retrospective studies from referral centers. The aim of this
               study was to assess the incidence, outcomes and predictors of
               the onset of PCD. METHODS: All incident cases of patients
               diagnosed with possible CD were prospectively registered from
               1994 to 1997 in Brittany, a limited area in France. At
               diagnosis, the clinical features of perianal disease were
               recorded. All patient charts were reviewed from the diagnosis to
               the last clinic visit in 2015. RESULTS: Among the 272 out of 331
               incident CD patients followed up, 51 (18.7\%) patients had PCD
               at diagnosis. After a mean follow-up of 12.8 years, 93 (34\%)
               patients developed PCD. The cumulative probabilities of perianal
               CD occurrence were 22\%, 29\%, and 32\% after 1 year, 5 years,
               and 10 years, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of anal
               ulceration were 14\%, and 19\% after 1 year and 10 years,
               respectively. Extraintestinal manifestations were associated
               with the occurrence of anal ulceration. The cumulative
               probabilities of fistulizing PCD were 11\%, 16\%, and 19\% after
               1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. Extraintestinal
               manifestations, rectal involvement and anal ulceration were
               predictors of fistulizing PCD. The cumulative probability of
               developing anal stricture was 4\% after 10 years. CONCLUSIONS:
               PCD is frequently observed during CD, in approximately one-third
               of patients. These data underline the need for targeted
               therapeutic research on primary perianal lesions (proctitis,
               anal ulceration) to avoid the onset of fistulizing perianal

               respectively. Approximately 11.5\% of patients (95\% CI,
               6.7\%-19.0\%) had perianal disease at or before CD diagnosis.
               Colonic disease location and rectal involvement were associated
               with higher risk of pCD. Overall, 63.3\% of patients (95\% CI,
               53.3-72.3) required minor perianal surgery and 6.4\% of patients
               (95\% CI, 1.8\%-20.6\%) required major abdominal surgery for
               pCD. Use of biologic therapy for pCD is common and has steadily
               increased throughout the years. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in
               5 patients with CD develops perianal disease within 10 years of
               CD diagnosis, including 11.5\% who have perianal disease at
               presentation. Approximately two-thirds of patients require
               perianal surgery, with a smaller fraction requiring major
               abdominal surgery.",

  abstract  = "AIM: Combined infliximab and sphincter-sparing surgery can be
               effective in perianal fistula associated with Crohn's disease
               (CD). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of local surgery
               combined with infliximab on sustained fistula closure and to
               identify predictive factors for response after this combined
               treatment. METHOD: Between 2000 and 2010, 81 patients with
               fistulising perianal CD were included in this observational
               study. Drainage with a loose seton was followed by infliximab
               therapy. The primary end-points were the rate of complete
               fistula closure and time required for this to occur. RESULTS:
               The fistula was complex in 71 (88\%) of the 81 patients. Local
               proctological surgery was carried out in 77 (95\%), including
               seton drainage in 62 (80.5\%) of these. This was continued for a
               median duration of 3.8 months and the patient then received
               infliximab therapy. The median follow-up after treatment was 64
               months (2-263). Initial complete closure of the fistula occurred
               in 71 (88\%) cases at a median interval of 12.4 months (1-147)
               from the start of treatment. Recurrence was observed in 29
               (41\%) patients at a median interval of 38.5 months (2-48) from
               the start of treatment. They were treated again with combined
               treatment with successful closure in 19 (65.5\%) patients. The
               total rate of closure of the fistula was 75.3\%. Female gender,
               anal stenosis, rectovaginal and complex fistula formation were
               factors independently associated with failure of combined
               treatment. CONCLUSION: Seton drainage for several months
               combined with infliximab therapy is effective in closing the
               fistula in 75\% of patients with complex perianal fistula
               formation associated with CD.",

               intestinal Crohn's disease; however, the efficacy of infliximab

               designed to compare patients with Crohn's disease who underwent
               perianal fistula surgery with or without infliximab infusion.
               METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 226 consecutive
               patients with Crohn's disease who underwent operative treatment
               with or without infliximab (3-6 infusions of 5 mg/kg) from March
               1991 through December 2005 was completed. Patients were
               classified as completely healed, minimally symptomatic (seton
               placement with minimal drainage and/or infliximab dependence),
               and failure (persistent or recurrent symptomatic fistula,
               diverting procedure, or proctectomy). RESULTS: A total of 226
               patients underwent operative treatment alone (n = 147) or in
               combination with infliximab infusion (n = 79). Age, gender, and
               preoperative history of intestinal and perianal Crohn's disease
               were similar between groups. Mean follow-up was 30 (range,
               6-216) months. Operative treatment consisted of seton drainage
               (n = 112), conventional fistulotomy (n = 92), fibrin glue
               injection (n = 14), advancement flap (n = 5), collagen plug
               insertion (n = 2), and transperineal repair (n = 1).
               Eighty-eight patients (60 percent) healed completely with
               operative treatment alone, and 47 patients (59 percent) healed
               after operative treatment in combination with infliximab (P =
               not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment of perianal
               fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease resulted in complete
               healing in approximately 60 percent of patients. Preoperative

               most severe phenotypes of inflammatory bowel diseases. Combined
               therapy with seton placement and anti-TNF therapy is the most

               study was to analyze the rates of complete perianal remission
               after combined therapy for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.
               METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study with
               perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease patients submitted to
               combined therapy from four inflammatory bowel diseases referral
               centers. We analyzed patients' demographic characteristics,
               Montreal classification, concomitant medication, classification
               of the fistulae, occurrence of perianal complete remission and
               recurrence after remission. Complete perianal remission was
               defined as absence of drainage from the fistulae associated with
               seton removal. DISCUSSION: A total of 78 patients were included,
               44 (55.8\%) females with a mean age of 33.8 ($\pm$15) years.
               Most patients were treated with Infliximab, 66.2\%, than with
               Adalimumab, 33.8\%. Complex fistulae were found in 52/78
               patients (66.7\%). After a medium follow-up of 48.2 months,
               41/78 patients (52.6\%) had complete perianal remission (95\%
               CI: 43.5\%-63.6\%). Recurrence occurred in four (9.8\%) patients
               (95\% CI: 0.7\%-18.8\%) in an average period of 74.8 months.

               inflammatory bowel diseases. The disease has become more
               widespread and the rise in the incidence has been reported in
               all age groups including early childhood and according to recent
               data also the elderly population. Some earlier studies have
               suggested that the phenotype and natural history of the disease
               may be different according to age of onset. Recently the
               importance of age at onset was reported in two population-based
               studies from France and Hungary including both paediatric and
               adult onset inception cohorts. Early onset disease was
               associated with more frequent disease extension in both Crohn's
               disease and ulcerative colitis and in most but not all studies
               with higher frequency of complicated disease behaviour. This is
               also accompanied by striking differences in the medical
               management with earlier and more prevalent (2-3-fold) use of
               immunosuppressives and to some extent biologicals in patients
               with early compared to elderly-onset disease, especially in
               Crohn's disease. However, the results of population-based
               studies on impact of age on surgery rates in Crohn´s disease as
               well as ulcerative colitis are conflicting. Furthermore,
               published data indicate that relative but not absolute risk of
               developing cancer and mortality is higher in patients with an
               early onset disease. Critical reviews that focus on the
               importance of age at onset in inflammatory bowel disease are
               rare. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the
               differences in epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and
               natural history of paediatric and elderly-onset inflammatory

              Complement Factor B (CFB). DESIGN: Immunochip-based meta-analysis
              on 4056 pCD and 11 088 patients with CD from three independent
              cohorts was performed. Serological and clinical variables were

              identified a genetic association for pCD (rs4151651), a
              non-synonymous SNP (G252S) in CFB, in all three cohorts.
              Recombinant S252 CFB had reduced binding to C3b, its cleavage was
              impaired, and complement-driven phagocytosis and cytokine
              secretion were reduced compared with G252 CFB. Serine 252
              generates a de novo glycosylation site in CFB. Serum from
              homozygous risk patients displayed significantly decreased
              macrophage phagocytosis compared with non-risk serum. CONCLUSION:
              pCD-associated rs4151651 in CFB is a loss-of-function mutation
              that impairs its cleavage, activation of alternative complement
              pathway, and pathogen phagocytosis thus implicating the
              alternative complement pathway and CFB in pCD aetiology.",

               incidence of perianal or rectovaginal fistulas and the
               associated proctectomy rate in the prebiologic era vs the
               biologic era using a population-based cohort of Crohn's disease
               (CD) patients. METHODS: The medical records of 414 residents of
               Olmsted County, Minnesota, who were diagnosed with CD between
               1970 and 2010 were reviewed. The cumulative incidence of
               perianal or rectovaginal fistulas from time of CD diagnosis and
               the cumulative rate of proctectomy from date of first perianal
               or rectovaginal fistula diagnosis were estimated using the
               Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (20.5\%)
               diagnosed with CD between 1970 and 2010 had at least 1 perianal
               or rectovaginal fistula episode between January 1, 1970, and
               June 30, 2016. The cumulative incidence of perianal or
               rectovaginal fistulas was 18\% after 10 years, 23\% after 20
               years, and 24\% after 30-40 years from CD diagnosis. The
               cumulative incidence of perianal or rectovaginal fistulas was
               significantly lower in patients diagnosed in 1998 or after than
               in patients diagnosed before 1998 (P = 0.03, log-rank). Among 85
               patients developing perianal or rectovaginal fistulas, 16
               patients (18.8\%) underwent proctectomy for the treatment of
               perianal or rectovaginal fistulas during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
               In a population-based inception cohort of CD, one-fifth of
               patients were diagnosed with at least 1 perianal or rectovaginal

               risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but precise
               independent localization of HLA effects is extremely
               challenging. As a result, the contribution of specific HLA
               alleles and amino-acid residues to the overall risk of SLE and
               to risk of specific autoantibodies are far from completely
               understood. Here, we dissected (a) overall SLE association
               signals across HLA, (b) HLA-peptide interaction, and (c)
               residue-autoantibody association. Classical alleles, SNPs, and
               amino-acid residues of eight HLA genes were imputed across 4,915
               SLE cases and 13,513 controls from Eastern Asia. We performed
               association followed by conditional analysis across HLA,
               assessing both overall SLE risk and risk of autoantibody
               production. DR15 alleles HLA-DRB1*15:01 (P = 1.4x10-27, odds
               ratio (OR) = 1.57) and HLA-DQB1*06:02 (P = 7.4x10-23, OR = 1.55)
               formed the most significant haplotype (OR = 2.33). Conditioned
               protein-residue signals were stronger than allele signals and
               mapped predominantly to HLA-DRB1 residue 13 (P = 2.2x10-75) and
               its proxy position 11 (P = 1.1x10-67), followed by HLA-DRB1-37
               (P = 4.5x10-24). After conditioning on HLA-DRB1, novel
               associations at HLA-A-70 (P = 1.4x10-8), HLA-DPB1-35 (P =
               9.0x10-16), HLA-DQB1-37 (P = 2.7x10-14), and HLA-B-9 (P =
               6.5x10-15) emerged. Together, these seven residues increased the
               proportion of explained heritability due to HLA to 2.6\%. Risk
               residues for both overall disease and hallmark autoantibodies
               (i.e., nRNP: DRB1-11, P = 2.0x10-14; DRB1-13, P = 2.9x10-13;

               of HLA-DRB1. Enrichment for specific amino-acid characteristics
               in the peptide-binding groove correlated with overall SLE risk
               and with autoantibody presence. Risk residues were in primarily
               negatively charged side-chains, in contrast with rheumatoid
               arthritis. We identified novel SLE signals in HLA Class I loci
               (HLA-A, HLA-B), and localized primary Class II signals to five
               residues in HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DQB1. These findings
               provide insights about the mechanisms by which the risk residues
               interact with each other to produce autoantibodies and are
               involved in SLE pathophysiology.",

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been
               widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex
               traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of
               familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well
               as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized)
               family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be
               routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis
               of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for
               relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating
               allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a
               strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This
               assumption is often untenable. RESULTS: Here, we present a rapid
               algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput
               genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of
               unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of
               individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of
               their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or
               population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation
               experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient
               power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated
               pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree
               relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap
               and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even
               under extreme population stratification, while algorithms
               assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased
               results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs
               relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a
               matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most
               efficient existing algorithm known to us. AVAILABILITY: Our
               robust relationship inference algorithm is implemented in a
               freely available software package, KING, available for download
